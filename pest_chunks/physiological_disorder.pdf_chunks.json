  "lint yield per hectare ( 375 kg ) is low as compared to the world average ( 650 kg ). under rainfed condition, cotton production mainly depends on the timing and amount of rain, which is unique in every year. the duration of cotton crop is quite long owing to its indeterminate growth habit. therefore, both genotype and environment have conspicuous effects on growth and development. in cotton, the growth profile has initial lag phase followed by an exponential phase coinciding with squaring, flowering and boll development. at flowering stage, there is a high demand for moisture, nutrients and photosynthates by the developing squares and bolls. the limitation in assimilate supply coupled with the production of hormones such as aba and ethylene imposes restriction on the plant to retain only few bolls which mature as open bolls. in this context, it is pertinent to know how abiotic and biotic factors affect the canopy leaf area available for capturing sunlight for the purpose of photosynthesis ( fig. 1 a & 1 b ). depending on the genotypes grown and the time and magnitude of occurrence of abiotic stresses such as drought, waterlogging, cloudiness, salinity, high or low temperature, nutrient deficiency etc., the vegetative and reproductive parts of the cotton plant develop various physiological disorders that either directly or indirectly affect the productivity. fig. 1. photosynthetic leaf area affected by a ) abiotic and b ) biotic stress factors b in view of the economic importance of this crop as well as the recent advances in scientific applications such as biotechnology / nanotechnology, it is imperative to know in detail technical bulletin from cicr ( www. cicr. org. in ) 5 physiological disorders in cotton about the various physiological disorders so as to effectively manage the crop from sowing to harvest. some of the commonly observed physiological disorders in cotton along with their symptoms and the options available to minimize their impact are presented in this bulletin. 2. physiological disorders physiological disorders appear in cotton as a reflex of plant response to environmental stresses, nutritional imbalances and chemical factors. their effect on productivity depends upon the crop growth stage, intensity of incidence and loss of reproductive parts during ontogeny. however, there is a distinct difference between plant adaptation to harsh growing environments and physiological disorders. the various adaptive traits in plants as a response to the stress environment such as production of small leaves during drought and lenticel formation under waterlogged condition are not considered as",
  "is a distinct difference between plant adaptation to harsh growing environments and physiological disorders. the various adaptive traits in plants as a response to the stress environment such as production of small leaves during drought and lenticel formation under waterlogged condition are not considered as physiological disorders. some of the commonly occurring physiological disorders in cotton are - leaf reddening parawilt / new wilt leaf drying / burn bud and boll drying bad boll opening crazy top crinkle leaf effect of 2, 4 - d bud and boll shedding : a natural phenomenon, may be considered as physiological disorder if the shedding is unusually prolonged and intense due to disturbances in source - sink relationship. mineral nutrients deficiency / toxicity : though nutrient deficiency / toxicity is not disorder in strict terms, it is worthwhile to know various symptoms because they affect the plant metabolism and cause various physiological disorders. 2. 1. leaf reddening leaf reddening in cotton is also known as red leaf disease ( lal patti ). this disorder is an outcome of interaction of location, variety, environmental condition and nitrogen supply. in general, some of the hirsutum varieties and a few inter and intra specific tetraploid hybrids are sensitive and vulnerable to this malady. apperance of red leaf symptom is primarily, due to the accumulation of anthocyanin pigment. leaf reddening may occur at any growth stage of the crop. however, it is quite often confused with the reddening of leaves caused by sucking pest damage at early growth stages. at grand growth phase ( flowering and boll development ) any hindrance in the assimilate production, translocation and distribution intensifies the leaf reddening effect. the factors affecting ideal source - sink relationship promote leaf reddening and symptoms are prolific in nature under extreme stress situations. technical bulletin from cicr ( www. cicr. org. in ) 6 physiological disorders in cotton symptoms leaf reddening is initially seen in the mature leaves and gradually spreads throughout the canopy ( fig. 2 a ). to begin with, leaf margin turns yellow and later red pigmentation is formed on the whole leaf area ( fig. 2b ). in due course of time the leaf becomes dry and subsequently prone to shedding. fig. 2a. leaf reddening in the plant canopy fig. 2b. intensity of leaf reddening as compared to normal leaf technical bulletin from cicr ( www. cicr. org. in ) 7 physiological disorders in cotton causes the redden",

  "day old are seldom shed. among the various canopy architectures, compact varieties are less prone to shedding. the process of shedding commences due to the formation of abscission layer. heavy boll load under conditions of optimum canopy production leads to inter and intra competition amongst the developing organs for current photosynthates. this condition may increase shedding of fruiting forms, if the demand is not immediately met with. several environmental and biological ( physiological and entomological ) events have a direct bearing on boll retention. environmental conditions which influence the shedding of fruiting parts in cotton are low light, high temperature, drought, waterlogging, cloudy weather etc. these factors affect assimilate translocation to the developing reproductive sinks leading to abscission. other major causes of abscission are lack of pollination due to very high temperature or rain falling on the open flower and insects that feed or oviposit on the fruiting forms. technical bulletin from cicr ( www. cicr. org. in ) 19 physiological disorders in cotton fig. 12. square at initial stage of its abscission table 4. correlation between morpho - physiological characters and abscission of fruiting parts from table 4 it is clear that significant correlation existed between morpho - physiological traits and physiological shedding of squares and bolls. flower production and transpiration had a significant positive correlation while, stomatal resistance had a significant negative correlation with physiological shedding. it implies that under favorable stomatal conductance large amount of current photosynthates are available to the developing sinks, which enabled the plants to produce more flowers. intensive flowering and the subsequent boll load on the other hand, would have limited assimilate distribution to the competitive sinks thus resulting in enhanced physiological shedding. negative correlation with stomatal resistance further signifies the importance of stomatal conductance for effective photosynthesis. though, significant correlation existed between flower production and physiological shedding, it may not remain so at all circumstances due to abiotic / biotic disruptive trends. technical bulletin from cicr ( www. cicr. org. in ) 20 physiological disorders in cotton a date of planting experiment with two cultivars viz. akh 081 and lra 5166 grown in pots with three distinct dates viz., 15th of june, july and august at cicr, nagpur indicated that delay in planting dates led to decrease in the production of nodes, leaves and squares per plant while there was a",

  ", experiments showed a transient benefit in growth and productivity of cotton with enhanced co 2 concentration. however, the associated rise in temperature with the greenhouse effect might offset this benefit because the concommitant increase in temperature may enhance both dark and photorespiration. technical bulletin from cicr ( www. cicr. org. in ) 24 physiological disorders in cotton leaf scorching observed in a few genotypes at present may become more prominent across genotypes as a result of rise in global temperature. boll setting may also get affected at high temperature regimes. the depletion of ozone layer in the earth ' s atmosphere due to the release of cfc ( clorofluoro carbon ), may lead to higher transmittance / incidence of short wave uv - b radiation that is harmful to the growth and development of crops leading to development of physiological disorders and low productivity. thus, there is further scope to unravel the causes and mechanisms involved in the manifestation of physiological disorders as well as those likely to emerge in the near future in a perspective and holistic approach. in this context, research linkages are to be established in the frontier arena pertaining to physiological, biochemical and molecular approaches. suggested for further reading : dastur, a. d. et., al ( 1960 ). cotton in india : a monograph. indian. central cotton committee, bombay. bhatt, j. g.
