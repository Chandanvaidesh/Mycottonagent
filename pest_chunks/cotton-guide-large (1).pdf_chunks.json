  "organic agriculture in the tropics, complemented by the ifoam training manual on organic agriculture in arid and semi - arid regions ². 4 organic cotton crop guide 1. 2 why organic cotton? organic cotton still only occupies a tiny niche of far less than 1 % of global cotton production. however, the number of farms converting to organic cotton and the number of projects is constantly increasing. at present, organic cotton cultivation is reported in the following countries : africa : benin, burkina faso, egypt, mali, mozambique, senegal, tanzania, togo, uganda, zambia, zimbabwe asia : china, india, kyrgyzstan, pakistan south america : argentina, brazil, nicaragua, paraguay, peru middle east : turkey, israel europe : greece usa australia there are a number of reasons to grow cotton organically. the negative impacts of conventional cotton farming on the environment and health are obvious and well known. some people may say : « why should i care about chemicals in cotton growing? we do not eat cotton. ' but if you look at the fact that around 60 % of the cotton weight harvest is cotton seed that is processed to edible oil and cattle feed, you realize that the bigger part of cotton production en - ters the human food chain. we also know that the pesticides sprayed on cotton do not only affect the target pest. beneficial insects and other animals are killed, too, so that pests that formerly were of minor importance now have become a major problem ( for example, whitefly and aphids ). in some areas of andhra pradesh the ground water has become so polluted with chemicals that people need to buy their drinking water from outside. in addition, many of the farmers and labourers spraying the pesticides face health problems that cause them to miss a lot of work and have additional costs for medical treatment. there are many cases in india where farmers have even died after applying chemical pesticides. in the hospital of warangal, andhra pradesh, up to a thousand farmers per month are treated because of pesticide intoxication. advantages of cultivating cotton organically organic seed cotton \" why should / care about chemicals in cotton growing? organic figure 1 : advantages of growing cotton organically, as compared to conventional farming organic cotton crop guide 5 figure 2 : successful organic cotton farming with a system approach in central india, many conventional farmers have faced a decline in soil fertility over the past two decades. in some cases the soil got so hard that the farmers had to give up groundnut cultivation. while cotton yields were on the decline, increasing amounts of",
  "in central india, many conventional farmers have faced a decline in soil fertility over the past two decades. in some cases the soil got so hard that the farmers had to give up groundnut cultivation. while cotton yields were on the decline, increasing amounts of fertilizers and pesticides were needed to maintain the crop. declining yields and increasing input costs, in combination with the frequent droughts, have left many farmers in a debt trap. when speaking to smallholder organic cotton farmers in developing countries, the following motivations are stated as the most important ones : to improve the fertility of the soil ( softer soil, greater absorption of water, better water holding capacity, healthy crops ) ; to reduce the production costs and thus the financial risk ; to get a better price for the cotton ( organic premium ) ; t o get rid of the negative effects of conventional farming : declining yields, resistance of pests and diseases, health hazards of chemicals ; market demand for textiles made from organic cotton mainly exists in europe, the usa, canada, japan and australia ( see chapter 8. 3 ). some large companies become involved with organic cotton textiles in order to improve their corporate image with respect to environmental and social accountability. the main reasons for consumers to buy textiles made out of organic cotton are : to reduce the risk of skin irritation and allergies ; to protect the environment from toxic chemicals ; to support sustainable agricultural production in the country where the cotton is grown ; to ensure that the farmers in developing countries receive a fair price. a comparison of the impacts of conventional ( ' chemical ' ) and organic farming on the environment, health, soil fertility, the cotton market, and the economy on the farm level is depicted in figure 1. to improve the profitability of the farm in the long run. 1. 3 growing organic cotton - a system approach successful organic cotton farming with a system approach capacity building improving and experimenting soil fertility documentation rotation & and inspection crop diversity timely and proper selecting the right picking cotton varieties monitoring organic of pests manures appropriate pest timely weeding and appropriate management intercult. operations irrigation crop converting a farm to organic production does not simply mean replacing chemical fertilizers and pesticides with organic ones. organic cotton must be grown in a diverse and balanced farming system that also includes the other crops. instead of troubleshooting, organic farmers should try to prevent problems and avoid substitutes to conventional inputs as far as pos - 6 organic cotton crop guide sible. this requires a thorough understanding of nutrient and pest management and the ability to continuously observe and",
  "instead of troubleshooting, organic farmers should try to prevent problems and avoid substitutes to conventional inputs as far as pos - 6 organic cotton crop guide sible. this requires a thorough understanding of nutrient and pest management and the ability to continuously observe and learn. to get satisfactory yields and income in organic cotton farming it is necessary to adopt a number of integrated measures in a system approach, ensuring that the interaction among soil, plants, environment and people is well balanced. the ' ingredients for success ' all need to be applied together ( figure 2 ) : suitable measures to improve and maintain soil fertility ; establishment of crop rotation and crop diversity ; fostering natural balance ; 1. 4 organic standards farmers who wish to sell their produce as ' organic ', whether in domestic markets or in export, need to be certified as organic. for this they need to strictly follow the national regulations 1 andorganic standards of the respective target country. for organic cotton to be exported to europe, the european regulation on organic farming ( eec 2092 / 91 2 ) defines the basic requirements to be fulfilled. other target markets have their own standards, e. g. the us ( nop 3 ) and japan ( jas 4 ). a premium price is possible only if there selection of varieties suitable to the conditions ( soil, availability of irrigation, market requirements ) ; appropriate types and amounts of manures at the right time ; timely crop management such as intercultural operations, weeding and irrigation ; careful monitoring of the crop and sufficient protection against pests according to the concept of economic threshold level ; timely and proper picking of the cotton ; sufficient documentation for inspection and certification ; capacity building and experimenting for continuous improvement. is mutual trust between producers and consumers. the consumer wants to be sure that the product is really organically produced. the organic farmer also needs to be protected against unfair competition from other farmers who use the term « organic » in a fraudulent way. organic standards define the minimum criteria to be fulfilled ( e. g. which fertilizers are not permitted ), but not necessarily best practices ( e. g. how much organic manure should be applied ). important requirements of most organic organic standards in cotton farming no application of any synthetic fertilizers such as urea, npk, dap etc. no application of synthetic pesticides ( including herbicides, insecticides, fungicides ) or growth promoters. no use of genetically modified organisms ( gmo ) such as bt - cotton varieties. crop rotation ( no cotton after cotton in the",

' some of the principles of bio - dynamic farming are : the farm organism : a farm is considered as a whole organism, integrating plants, animals and humans. there should be just the right number of animals to provide manure for fertility, and these animals should be fed from the farm itself. for organic textiles from the harvesting of fibres to the labelling of ready - made textiles. it also covers processing requirements ( e. g.",
  "number of animals to provide manure for fertility, and these animals should be fed from the farm itself. for organic textiles from the harvesting of fibres to the labelling of ready - made textiles. it also covers processing requirements ( e. g. regarding toxicity and biodegradability of materials used ) and social criteria. the standard is expected to facilitate the certification process and to provide end consumers with a credible assurance system for organic garments. bio - dynamic preparations : certain naturally occurring plant and animal materials are combined in specific preparations and applied in highly diluted form to compost piles, to the soil, or directly to the plants. the forces within these preparations are to organize the elements within the plants and animals. cosmic rhythms : the rhythms of the sun, moon, planets, and stars influence the growth of plants. by timing the activities of tillage, sowing and harvesting according to the bio - dynamic calendar, the farmer can use this influence to benefit the crops. vitality : besides the physical and chemical characteristics, matter has a vital quality that influences organisms. thus, bio - dynamic farmers strive for product quality, not just quantity. as far back as 1928 the bio - dynamic movement developed the demeter brand for labelling products from certified bio - dynamic farms 3. 1. 6 inspection and certification in order to support farmers in the certification process and to reduce costs, farmer groups can be organized within an internal control system ( ics ). for this, each farmer needs to sign a contract with the organization in which they declare their commitment to following the specific organic standards of the project. the extension workers of the project advise the farmers in organic crop production techniques and help them with the necessary record - keeping. internal inspectors inspect the farms several times a year, and an internal certification committee decides about sanctions against defaulting farmers. at least once a year, an external certifier inspects the functioning of the ics and re - inspects a certain percentage of the farms at random ( figure 4 ). if the external inspection finds that the ics is not functioning properly, for example because defaulting farmers are not discovered and excluded from the project, the entire project risks losing its organic certification and thus the option of selling the cotton and other crops at a premium price. therefore, internal control systems can only function if there is a spirit of trust and cooperation among the involved farmers and between the farmers and the organization responsible for the ics. 1 international association natural textile industry ( ivn ), germany ; institute for market ecology ( imo",

  "seed companies and cannot be multiplied without the parent lines. in india, research stations have also developed a number of non - hybrids, the seeds of which can be re - grown for a number of years. organic cotton farmers in mali also use the cotton seeds from their own harvest. breeding of varieties specifically suited to organic farming conditions remains a challenge to be tackled in coming years. bt cotton in organic agriculture the use of genetically modified organisms ( gmo ) is not allowed. for some years, seed companies have been promoting genetically engineered ' bt cotton '. it contains genes of the same micro - organism, bacillus thuringiensis, that is used in bio - control against a number of insect pests, also by organic farmers. the bt cotton plant thus continuously produces an insecticide that is to prevent bollworms from feeding on it. however, bollworms frequently develop resistance, forcing the seed companies to develop new varieties of bt cotton. also, there is a risk that the development of resistance makes bt sprays less effective, thus harming organic farmers. testing cotton varieties for organic farming in kirgistan ( photo : helvetas ) the cultivation of bt cotton involves higher financial risk, since the seeds are considerably more expensive and usually the crop is grown with high inputs of fertilizers and pesticides against sucking pests. in india, many conventional farmers who tried bt cotton complained about crop failure, due possibly to inappropriate varieties, unfavourable climatic conditions, or adulterated seeds. despite the benefits promised by its promoters, growing bt cotton seems to be a high - risk strategy. organic farmers find it more and more difficult to get cottonseed material that is guaranteed gmo - free. some certification bodies use test stripes to check whether cotton plants contain gmo. organic cotton crop guide 13 3 soil fertility management 3. 1 soil properties the best strategy for improving and maintaining soil fertility in cotton primarily depends on the soil types present on a farm. soil types in the nimar region, india, can be broadly grouped into light soils ( inceptisol ), medium soils ( entisol ) and heavy soils ( ' black cotton soil ', vertisol ). their distribution in the landscape mainly depends on the profile ( see graph below ). light soils usually have a lower water - retention capacity, and the nutrients are more easily leached out than in heavy soils. in light soils, the soil toposequence in the nimar region soils in the nimar region, india, usually follow",
  "soils usually have a lower water - retention capacity, and the nutrients are more easily leached out than in heavy soils. in light soils, the soil toposequence in the nimar region soils in the nimar region, india, usually follow a sequence, with light and sandy soils on elevations and deep and heavy soils in depressions and river belts typical soils in the nimar region light soil ( inceptisol ) medium soil ( entisol ) heavy soil ( black cotton soil, vertisol ) rock application of compost is particularly important for increasing water retention and nutrient supply. as these soils are less suitable for intensive production, the variety and crop selection should be adapted accordingly ( robust, frugal, and drought - resistant cotton varieties and rotation crops ). intercropping of more droughtresistant crops like sorghum, safflower, sesame, or castor can help to reduce the risk of complete crop failure in drought - prone areas. soil cultivation should be shallow and kept to a minimum in order to avoid soil erosion and enhanced decomposition of organic matter. in deep or heavy soils ( e. g. black cotton soil ), intensive production is possible with sufficient inputs of organic manures, intensive crop rotation, and green manuring. frequent shallowsoil cultivation helps to improve soil aeration and nutrient supply. it also reduces evaporation and suppresses weeds. when the cotton crop is well established ( after 6 - 9 weeks ) it is recommended to apply additional organic manure ( e. g. vermi - compost or oil cakes ) and to earth up ridges in order to accelerate decomposition of manures and to bury weeds. the soil properties and management recommendations for light and heavy soils are given in figure 7. soil types and their management soil profile in a cotton field in india figure 7 : properties and management recommendations for light and heavy soils 14 organic cotton crop guide 3. 2 the importance of soil organic matter cotton prefers fertile soils with good water holding capacity and sufficient nutrient supply ( see chapter 2. 2 ). on many farms, the continuous application of chemical fertilizers has led to a loss of soil fertility. this is mainly due to a lack of organic matter - the residues of plant material and organic manures remaining in the soil. the application of nitrogen fertilizer accelerates the decomposition of organic matter. they are available to the crop. last but not least, organic material feeds and hosts a huge number of beneficial soil organisms, such as earth worms and microbes, which",
  ". the application of nitrogen fertilizer accelerates the decomposition of organic matter. they are available to the crop. last but not least, organic material feeds and hosts a huge number of beneficial soil organisms, such as earth worms and microbes, which continuously work toward improving soil fertility. organic matter has a very crucial significance for soil fertility improvement ( figure 8 ). it ensures a soft and loose soil with good porosity and thus good infiltration of water. the organic matter particles act like tiny sponges, thus keeping the soil moist for a longer time. organic matter takes up and releases nutrients so that thus, for getting good, stable yields it is important that organic farmers ensure a continuous supply of organic material to the soil - not only for cotton! the most important source of organic matter are the residues of the crops grown on the field itself ( leaves, stalks, roots etc. ). therefore, balanced crop rotation, intercropping, and mulching are the most efficient ways to enhance soil fertility. this is complemented by the application of farmyard manure, compost and organic manures such as oil cakes, press mud, etc. ( see chapter 4. 5 ). why organic matter is so important a loose and soft good aeration and infiltration of rain and irrigation water good soil structure with a lot of cavities non - visible parts of organic matter act like visible parts of glue, sticking soil organic matter act particles together like sponges soil organic matter provides suitable environment for soil organisms many beneficial soil organisms such as earth worms feed on organic material tiny 3. 3 crop rotation - rotation crops it is important that organic cotton is grown in rotation with other crops. this helps to improve and maintain soil fertility and ensures balanced nutrient contents in the soil. if cotton is grown continually on the same field, yields are likely to decrease. crop rotation and mixed cropping also help prevent build - up of pest populations, diseases and weeds. pests find it more difficult figure 8 : the importance of organic matter for soil fertility wheat grown in the winter season ( rabi ) after cotton organic cotton crop guide 15 pulses and cereals in an indian market crop rotation rotation crops on organic farms, cotton should not be grown in fields where the previous year ' s crop also was cotton ( no ' cotton after cotton ' ). the reason is that if cotton is grown year after year in the same field, the soil nutrients get depleted, pest populations increase and there is a risk for soilborne diseases. at least for one year, but prefer",
  "' cotton after cotton ' ). the reason is that if cotton is grown year after year in the same field, the soil nutrients get depleted, pest populations increase and there is a risk for soilborne diseases. at least for one year, but preferably for two years, another crop should be grown between two cotton crops. if very small land holdings force farmers to grow cotton after cotton, they should, in any case, use an intercrop ( e. g. moong bean, cow pea, or chick pea, for harvesting ) or a green manure crop ( e. g. sun hemp or cow pea, to be cut and ploughed back into the soil before flowering ). crops like chillies or vegetables, and after sugarcane and wheat. organic farmers in particular should take care to include pulses in the rotation, as they increase the nitrogen content in the soil by fixing nitrogen from the air. particularly good yields are achieved when cotton is grown after pulses ( soy bean, chickpea, pigeon pea, groundnut etc. ), horticultural in some places a crop of wheat, pulses or fodder can be grown after cotton in the winter season. in india, where sufficient irrigation is available, farmers usually uproot the cotton crop before the second flush, in order to grow a wheat or chickpea crop in the ' rabi ' season. growing wheat instead of continuing to harvest the cotton is usually more remunerative, as the gains from the wheat crop more than compensate for the loss in cotton yields and the additional production costs. however, sufficient availability of irrigation water and of labour are important pre - conditions for this. figure 9 : some crop rotation patterns from organic cotton projects in india and africa to move from one host plant to another, and they are controlled by a number of beneficial insects hosted by the rotation crops or intercrops. crop diversity also reduces a farmer ' s risk, making farmers less vulnerable to crop failure and to fluctuating prices. further, it helps prevent a shortage of labour in peak seasons, as labour requirements are more evenly distributed throughout the year. depending on the climatic conditions, the market situation and the availability of land, there are a number of suitable rotation patterns, with cotton grown every alternate or every third year. which rotation pattern is the most suitable one for a particular farm depends on a number of factors : soil properties, irrigation facilities, crop prices, market access, and - last but not least the skills and preferences of the farmer. figure 9 lists some suitable rotation patterns",

( especially of nitrogen ) during this phase, it is recommended that a basal dose of well - decomposed compost or farmyard manure be applied at the start of the growing season, and be complemented with one or two head applications of compost and an organic manure rich in nitrogen ( e. g. oil cakes, poultry manure from extensive rearing ). head applications of manure should be applied 2 - 3 weeks before the start of square bud formation, as the nutrients are not instantly available but only get released once the manure decomposes ( see figure 11 ). like other crops, cotton requires the full range of nutrients in a well - balanced composition. the cotton plant requires two - thirds ( 2 / 3 ) of these nutrients during the first two months of its growth. to ensure sufficient nutrient supply a harvest of 500 kg seed cotton extracts approximately 36 kg nitrogen ( n ), 14 kg phosphate ( p2o5 ) and 15 kg potassium ( k2o equivalents ). parts of these nutrients may be replaced through nitrogen fixation by legumes ( n ) and through weathering of minerals ( p and k ). figure 1 1 : nutrient demands of cotton and timing of manure applications timing of nutrient supply in the cotton crop maximum nutrient demand demand demand partly nutrient supply basal covered 1 demand fully covered second 1 top dressing flush dressing time top formation flowering picking sowing picking first ' continuous boll first ' organic cotton crop guide 19 4. 2 uptake of nutrients in organically managed soils, the crops mainly depend on the nutrients supplied by minerals and by the organic matter in the soil. these take up, store and release nutrients ( through exchange, weathering, and decomposition ). soil organisms play a vital role in this process and should",

  "the soil for the decomposition of carbon - rich ( sturdy ) organic material. as a result, the leaves of the cotton plants look yellowish, growth is stunted and overall crop development is slow. this phenomenon known as ' temporary nitrogen immobilization ' may occur when sturdy crop residues or manures ( e. g. straw - rich farmyard manure or undecomposed press mud ) are present in the soil. t o decompose this material, microbes require nitrogen, which is not available to the crop for a certain period of time. to avoid this situation, collect the sturdy crop residues before ploughing the fields and prepare compost out of them. compost should be kept moist and should be turned at least twice so that it decomposes well. it should be applied to the field early in the season so that the decomposition has already started when the cotton is sown. at the time of sowing, nitrogen - rich manures such as oil cakes can be applied to prevent this problem. oil cakes take 1 - 3 weeks until they release nitrogen through decomposition. soil cultivations ( intercultural operations ) speed up the decomposition of organic matter and thus increase the nutrient supply to the crop. 4. 3 application of manures and fertilizers suitable application doses of nutrients in organic cotton depend on the soil condition, the previous crop, and the expected yield. table 3 shows the nutrient quantities recommended for organic cotton for soil of average fertility cultivated with high - yield varieties. a considerable portion of the required nutrients, however, can be supplied through decomposing residues of the previous crop, and through nitrogen fixation by leguminous crops. organic manures like compost and cattle dung contain the full range of nutrients including micronutrients in a balanced composition. thus, where organic manures are applied in sufficient quantity, usually there is no deficiency of micronutrients. practise crop rotation, and grow leguminous crops ( e. g. pulses ) as intercrops or as green manures ; use all biomass available on the farm ( do not burn crop residues or cow dung! ) ; mix wood ash into the compost heap ; use whatever biomass is cheaply available nearby ( e. g. weeds, leaves, press mud, agricultural processing wastes ) ; only then complement with purchased organic manures ( e. g. oil cakes ) and natural mineral fertilizers ( e. g. rock phosphate, gypsum, muriate of potash ). farmers",

' stress can also be caused by water shortage or waterlogging. just like humans or animals, plants also have a kind of im - figure 17 : measures used to keep a cotton crop healthy organic cotton crop guide 29 mune system, which usually enables them to fight an attack of sucking pests. in stress situations, this immune system works less effectively. therefore it is important to avoid stress situations for the plant. this primarily means : a neither too little nor too much manure ( no ' overfeeding ' ). a careful irrigation, avoiding dryness and waterlogging. a shallow soil cultivation ( intercultural operations ) to encourage soil aeration and decomposition of organic matter. with these preventive measures properly implemented, the pest problem in organic cotton is surprisingly minor. a certain level of pest attack will not significantly reduce the cotton yield. below the ' economic threshold ', the cost and effort to control the pest is higher than the damage it causes. in this regard, one should take into account both the",

  "but can also lead to the depletion of these freshwater resources and to problems owing to soil salinization or waterlogging. organic soil management usually leads to better soil structure and thus to better infiltration of water. increasing soil organic matter also improves water retention in the soil and thus allows the crop to better sustain dry periods. therefore, conversion to organic agriculture can help increase the water - use efficiency in cotton cultivation. it is time for the next irrigation. during the first 6 - 7 weeks after sowing, irrigation should be moderate in order to avoid too heavy vegetative growth, and to encourage cotton roots to penetrate deeply into the soil. for monsoon - sown cotton in india, the first irrigation should not be done until august, after the first square buds have formed. in irrigated cotton, the application system, intensity and timing of irrigation are crucial for good yields and healthy plants. when the cotton leaves start wilting in the morning sun, it is time for irrigation. in india, some farmers use a local plant called ' croton ' to indicate water stress : when the croton plant first starts to wilt, the cotton crop is very sensitive to waterlogging, which causes increased boll shedding, thus affecting yields. waterlogging causes general yellowing and stunted growth of the plant. it also reduces the availability of nutrients. thus, in fields prone to waterlogging ( heavy soil ), measures done to improve soil structure ( organic matter application ) are more relevant than the application of fertilizers. it is important that furrow irrigation be done quickly ( not exceeding 4 hours ). this can be achieved by shortening the rows. 7. 2 water harvesting and saving in rain - fed cotton, and in regions with limited availability of irrigation water ( i. e. in most semi - arid cotton - growing areas ), major emphasis should be given to increasing the infiltration of rainwater into the soil and to preserving soil moisture. for this, the application of compost and organic manures is crucial. shallow soil cultivation ( hoeing ) breaks the soil capillaries and thus reduces evaporation. mulching also helps to preserve humidity in the soil. in some regions, black plastic mulch is used, but its ecological and economical suitability is doubtful. active rainwater harvesting through pits or trenches leading to wells can help to recharge groundwater levels and thus to improve the availability of irrigation water. where little irrigation water is available, alternate - furrow irrigation can still",
  "and economical suitability is doubtful. active rainwater harvesting through pits or trenches leading to wells can help to recharge groundwater levels and thus to improve the availability of irrigation water. where little irrigation water is available, alternate - furrow irrigation can still help irrigate the crop. if rains fail after the seedlings have germinated, it can even be worth it to save them through bucket irrigation, plant by plant. 46 organic cotton crop guide 7. 3 drip irrigation in india, drip irrigation systems are becoming increasingly popular for cotton. they enable farmers to start cotton cultivation before the onset of the rainy season, to bridge dry periods and to protect at least part of their fields from drought. drip systems make it possible to grow ' more crop per drop ' as the water directly reaches the root zones of the plants and less is lost to infiltration and evaporation. it also discourages weeds from growing between the cotton rows. fibre quality is also found to be higher in drip - irrigated cotton, as it allows better finetuning of the irrigation water quantity to the plants ' needs. however, investments and labour requirements are higher, and intercultural operations become more difficult. another possible disadvantage of drip systems in organic cotton is that the decomposition of organic manures is slower, as only a small part of the soil gets moist. in organic farming, the decomposition of organic manures is of particular importance for ensuring a continuous nutrient supply to the plant. recently, several new low - cost drip systems have come on the market ( see figure 20 ). they allow farmers to install drip - irrigation systems with lower investment costs, but the cheaper systems are usually less durable. low - cost irrigation in cotton drip normal drip system ( approx. 1100 uss per ha ) drip \" system ( approx. 400 uss per ha ) \" easy \" pepsee \" drip system ( approx. 220 uss per ha ) figure 20 : drip, ' easy drip ' and ' pepsee drip ' systems for cotton organic cotton crop guide 47 8 harvest and post - harvest operations 8. 1 quality issues in cotton picking the quality of the cotton harvest depends on the length of the fibre ( staple length ), on the degree of contamination with non - fibre material such as leaves or dust, and on the portion of fibre damaged by pest or disease infestation. good - quality raw material helps to produce yarns and garments of high quality, and thus eventually contributes to the market success of the organic cotton project. when cotton buyers fix prices, they usually take into consideration the quality",

  "sustainable income through organic production : by increasing and sustaining crop yields through improved soil fertility ; by reducing costs of production ( especially for off - farm inputs ) ; by getting a better price for their produce ( organic premium, market access ) ; by reducing the risks of production ( especially of droughts and pest damage ). organic farmers get the maximum benefit when they manage to combine all these approaches. income = ( yield x price ) x risk factor production costs reduce the risk of stabilize yields production value addition reduce input costs organic price direct fair premium market links with organic cotton, it appears that farmers basically follow one of two different strategies to achieve good profits ( figure 23 ) : the first strategy ( ' intensive organic ' ) aims to achieve high yields through optimum nutrient supply and crop care. farmers following this strategy typically buy organic manures from outside ( cow dung, oil cakes ), irrigate their fields intensively and take a number of measures to protect their crops. this is a strategy typically followed by farmers with more resources ( larger land holdings, good irrigation facilities, fertile soils ). the second strategy ( ' low cost, low risk ' ) tries to reduce production costs and the risk of production, targeting medium yields. farmers fol - lowing this strategy basically try to produce all the inputs on the farm itself ( compost, botanical pesticides, liquid manures etc. ) and do most farming activities with family labour. this low external - input strategy can help to reduce risk in areas of frequent crop loss due to droughts, waterlogging or theft, as farmers need to invest less money into the crop. of course it is not possible to draw a clear line between the two strategies. still, this basic distinction can help farmers to make their farming more profitable, and extension services to adjust their services to the requirements of different farmers. figure 22 : ways to improve farmers ' income through organic production organic cotton crop guide 51 figure 23 : two strategies for achieving good revenues from organic cotton. strategies in organic cotton farming strateqy i : intensive orqanic strategy il : low input ; _ low risk high yields, but relatively high production costs high loss in case crop fails production costs revenues smaller yields, but also lower production costs, thus still good income lower loss in case crop fails production costs revenues the results of a study conducted in the maikaal biore project in india showed that both strategies have been successfully implemented by the farmers. table 9 shows the data for two farmers from this study. farmer i is a small farmer with little irrigation",

  "53 extension staff of maikaal biore support a farmer in record keeping 9. 5 the conversion process probably the most important hurdle for organic cotton production is the challenge of getting through the conversion process. during this phase, most farmers experience a drop in yields ( 10 - 50 %, depending on the level of previous yields and the methods used ), while at the same time measures to re - establish soil fertility require additional effort and labour. with proper organic management implemented, yields usually recover after 2 - 3 years, as the soil builds up organic matter and populations of soil organisms increased. pest problems are also usually higher in the initial years, as the eco - system that got disturbed through the continuous application of chemical pesticides first needs to get into balance and populations of beneficial insects need to build up. it is also obvious that organic farming requires new skills, and, therefore, training and experimenting. with increasing experience, the performance of the farmer will improve, too. still, simple maintenance of crop records can help farmers and projects to get a fairly good idea of the economic performance of the crops and farms. experience from several projects indicates that record - keeping can lead to improved performance as farmers become more aware of where they lose and where they gain. annex 10. 6 provides a template with which farmers can easily keep crop records ( of cotton or other crops ). it can help them to keep clear track of inputs, costs, harvests and revenues. with simple calculations, one can compile yields, total production costs and net profits. when records are kept over a period of several years, they provide insight into the changes in the farm economy, for example during the conversion period. thus they can also help the farmer to fine - tune and optimize the production system. if farmers are organized in a group, these crop records provide the organizers with valuable data for planning and monitoring. the data of all farmers in the project are compiled into a simple database 1. the project ' s extension team can assist the farmers in record - keeping and help them to calculate the results. organic farming is a knowledge - intensive type of production, and thus competent extension services play an important role. especially during the conversion period, it is crucial that farmers get competent and timely advice. organic cotton projects could consider organizing trainings for farmers interested in conversion, in which they prepare for the conversion process. rather than only promoting organic farming, extension staff should openly address the necessity of working hard during the conversion period and the possible problems to be expected. conversion to organic farming usually results in",
  "farmers interested in conversion, in which they prepare for the conversion process. rather than only promoting organic farming, extension staff should openly address the necessity of working hard during the conversion period and the possible problems to be expected. conversion to organic farming usually results in more diversity : in crops grown, in types of activities and in the solution of problems. appropriate measures can help to reduce problems encountered during the conversion process. the initial drop in yields, for example, can be reduced through sufficient application of organic manures ( if necessary brought in from outside the farm ). it is also advisable to intercrop cotton with pulses ( e. g. moong bean, cow pea ), which supplies nitrogen to the soil and provides additional income. other success factors in the conversion process are listed in figure 25. 1 a free template of record forms and a database for managing farm records is available at www. fibl. org / english / cooperation / projects / organiccotton. php. 54 organic cotton crop guide success factors in the conversion to organic cotton farming getting ready adequate training in organic agriculture and organic cotton production involve the family in decision making develop strategies to cope with initial drop in yields and higher labour requirement competent and timely advice on organic crop management regular exchanges with experienced organic farmers adapting the production system out organic technologies on small plots to gain experience try identify suitable crop rotation, green manures and intercrops ensure sufficient input of organic matter ( if necessary from outside the farm ) 9. 6 the role of women in organic cotton production although on many farms, especially in india, most decisions are still taken by men, women play an important role in organic farming. in india, their traditional responsibilities in cotton farming include looking after the animals and the dung, sowing, weeding, and picking. men usually are responsible for soil cultivation, application of manures and sprays, and intercultural operations. shifting to organic farming can therefore mean a shift in workload between men and women : the time needed for compost preparation and perhaps for weeding might increase as well, while the time needed for spraying pesticides usually decreases. proper plant nutrition, timely weeding and careful picking, however, are crucial for getting good results in cotton. participate in training activities and meetings. extension services of the project should always give special consideration to gender issues and also reach out to women. having female staff on the team, and female farmer representatives in the organization, can help organic cotton projects to achieve these aims. conversion to organic cotton farming is not only a question of production techniques",
  "special consideration to gender issues and also reach out to women. having female staff on the team, and female farmer representatives in the organization, can help organic cotton projects to achieve these aims. conversion to organic cotton farming is not only a question of production techniques ; it has equally important implications for the social and economic level of the household. thus the different perceptions and needs of the family members should be taken into consideration when thinking about conversion. organic cotton projects should ensure that women are included in decision - making processes, especially concerning the conversion process. for this, they should be encouraged to a lady farmer removing weeds in an organic cotton field in mali ( photo : helvetas ) figure 25 : success factors in the conversion to organic cotton farming organic cotton crop guide 55 10 annex 10. 1 glossary asafetida bio - dynamic agriculture border crop certification conversion cotton lint crop rotation de - oiled cake of castor ( doc ) ' desi ' cotton economic threshold extension service fair trade certification farmyard manure ( fym ) ginning gossypol green manure gross margin intercropping internal control system ( ics ) integrated pest management ( ipm ) leguminous crops a hard resinous gum gained from the roots of a giant perennial fennel species. it is used as a spice in indian cuisine, and in medical treatments. special type of organic agriculture based on the research work and philosophy of rudolf steiner. it includes the use of plant - based or animal - based preparations and considers cosmic rhythms. crop grown at the edge of organic fields bordering conventionally managed fields in order to reduce drift of pesticide sprays. a process verifying the compliance of farm management with organic standards ; based on inspection of the farm and its documentation. the process of changing the farm management from conventional to organic practices as per the organic standards. cotton fibre without seeds. sequence of crops grown in a field over several years. residues of crushed castor seeds after oil extraction. it is used as an organic manure rich in nitrogen ( 4 - 5 % ) and phosphorus. indigenous cotton varieties grown on the indian sub - continent, belonging to the species gossypium herbaceum or g. arboretum. the level of pest infestation below which the damage caused by the pest is lower than the cost of control efforts. a support system for farmers, usually provided by the ngo or company organizing the organic project. services may include training, technical advice, internal control, supply of farm inputs and marketing. a certification scheme for trade relations between farmer",
