  "requires the crop manager to implement a mix of pre - emptive and responsive pest management actions to reduce the risk of crop loss and improve the health of both the environment and ourselves. the outcome of an effective ipm system is long term stable management of pests and beneficials, reducing the risk of resistance, so that economic losses of crop yield and quality and threats to human health and the environment can be minimised. ipm - the basics practices that form a solid basis for implementing ipm on your farm include : farm hygiene. minimise cotton volunteers, ratoons and other weeds in fallow fields, field edges, roadways and drainage lines to limit the survival and spread of overwintering pests such as mealybugs or resistant aphids that might also carry bunchy top disease. put simply, clean farms tend to have less pest problems than dirty ones. preventing problems. sowing date, crop sequences and field selection are just some of the tactics available to disadvantage pests. avoiding back - to - back cotton in fields that had mealybugs to limit season carryover, or not planting as late so that your crop is not exposed to displaced populations of silverleaf whitefly ( slw ) are just two examples of how to strategically avoid giving pests the upper hand. grow a healthy crop. cotton plants have a significant ability to recover from damage ( especially early season damage ) with no reduction in yield or delay in maturity. plant monitoring in conjunction with regular insect monitoring allows an assessment of pest effects that might be difficult to detect in regular sampling. plant monitoring can dryland cotton … dryland cotton has the same pests and beneficials as irrigated crops. effective ipm and resistance management are critical regardless of where or how cotton is grown. a key ipm challenge for dryland crops in minimum tillage systems is to ensure 100 % crop destruction. ratoon cotton or volunteers that emerge in a subsequent grain crop can provide a green bridge for pests and diseases. crop mulching or slashing alone at the end of the season is not sufficient to prevent pest carryover unless it is followed with tactics that prevent regrowth. best practice … knowledge is the key that unlocks effective ipm. seek to prevent pest outbreaks through good farm hygiene, complementary crop rotation and conserving beneficial populations. regularly monitor pest species, beneficials, crop stage, crop growth and the weather. bring it all together with effective management action that is mindful of pest thresholds, resistance risks and potential impacts",
  ", complementary crop rotation and conserving beneficial populations. regularly monitor pest species, beneficials, crop stage, crop growth and the weather. bring it all together with effective management action that is mindful of pest thresholds, resistance risks and potential impacts on natural enemies, bees and the environment. assist in decision making where pest levels are just below threshold or where there are combinations of pests present. acceptable damage levels will vary depending on crop physiology stage, yield expectations and climatic conditions. sample your crop effectively. detecting and being able to quantify both pests and beneficials is a fundamental requirement for good decision making. depending on the crop stage and pest or beneficial type, sampling techniques may vary. while some thresholds only require monitoring of one lifecycle stage, awareness of all life stages can help identify if a population has built up within the crop or has migrated in recently. take note of where your crop is at. the development stage of your crop has a big bearing on ( i ) whether it is susceptible to yield loss and ( ii ) if it can recover from pest damage without intervention. minimal squares on a normal crop at 10 - 12 nodes might indicate poor retention due to pest or weather damage, but if the plant has been developmentally delayed, the retention levels may be appropriate. cotton can compensate for early season damage, particularly vegetative plant parts, if growing conditions remain favourable. ensure you can distinguish between vegetative and fruiting branches when measuring retention during early crop development. view a cottoninfo video that explains the difference between branch types in young crops : https : / / youtu. be / 7pxiauinmey pests that can contaminate open cotton with honeydew ( such as slw or aphids ) become more important as bolls open. know your enemy. this guide outlines the key pests that you would expect to deal with on a regular basis when growing cotton. key to managing these pests is to understand what they are, what damage they cause, preventative steps you can take to minimise their numbers or impact, how best to sample for them, when control is likely to be required ( action thresholds ), and what types of control techniques ( chemical, biological or physical etc ) are likely to be suitable and effective. knowledge of the pest ' s interaction with the environment can help determine whether a spray is warranted. for example, two - spotted mite populations can be suppressed by cool conditions, but will increase rapidly when it is hot and dry. know your",
  ". knowledge of the pest ' s interaction with the environment can help determine whether a spray is warranted. for example, two - spotted mite populations can be suppressed by cool conditions, but will increase rapidly when it is hot and dry. know your friends. cotton crops host a diverse array of beneficials that can suppress pests, particularly mites, slw, aphids and mealybugs. noting which beneficials are present when sampling can help inform your control decisions. conserving beneficials can have a significant impact on whether you develop a mite or mealybug problem later in the season. table 4 ( see pages 14 - 15 ) allows you to compare the potential impact of different products so that you can make a balanced control decision. cotton pest management guide 2022 - 23 5 insects ipm do you even need to spray? many pest insects have scientificallybased action thresholds that can help you decide whether your pest populations or crop damage might require control action. resist the urge to use insecticides prophylactically with herbicide application operations. economic thresholds are defined as the pest density or damage level at which control must be implemented to prevent economic loss, and should be considered in the context of other factors that may influence the need to spray. for pest abundance just over threshold but with low damage and high beneficial populations, consider delaying control for several days. this is a low risk strategy to allow time for beneficials to reduce pest levels to below threshold, thereby avoiding a potentially disruptive spray and reducing insecticide costs and selection for resistance. conversely, for high pest damage with low beneficial populations, immediate control with an insecticide may be the best option. thresholds for cotton aphid, two - spotted mite and slw are based on cumulative population changes and require comparison of multiple samplings to determine if action thresholds have been reached. choose insecticides wisely. when insecticide control is warranted make sure the product you have selected appropriately balances effectiveness against the target pest with any potential harm to natural enemies. being aware of the product ' s mode of action ( moa ) group, and actively avoiding the use of broad - spectrum disruptive insecticides ( e. g. organophosphates, pyrethroids and some neonicotinoids ) wherever possible, especially early to mid - season, will go a long way to reducing mite, slw and mealybug numbers later in the season. also be aware of restrictions on the use of certain products as",
  "neonicotinoids ) wherever possible, especially early to mid - season, will go a long way to reducing mite, slw and mealybug numbers later in the season. also be aware of restrictions on the use of certain products as part of the industry ' s insecticide resistance management strategy ( irms ). if several pesticide options are available, examine their selectivity profiles ( see table 4 ). for example, clothianidin will reduce populations of ladybird beetles ( aphid predators ) and eretmocerus wasps ( whitefly parasitoids ) but conserve predatory bugs and thrips ( mite predators ). in contrast, the low rate of fipronil will reduce predatory bug populations, and conserve ladybird beetles, but its impact on the key wasp parasitoids of whitefly is unknown. increases in populations of non - target pests such as aphid, mite and whitefly may follow insecticide applications if the beneficial populations keeping them in check are disrupted. lower registered rates of a product may provide sufficient efficacy against the target pest, while minimising impact on beneficials. preserve the usefulness of insecticides and bollgard. the ability of insecticides or bacillis thuringiensis ( bt ) protein - expressing bollgard crops to provide control depends on pest populations being susceptible to the active compounds. follow label directions and consider both your application technique and environmental conditions to optimise chemical efficacy. adhere to resistance management programs to ensure that the industry continues to have access to pest control tactics that give good control. look after bees. bees are particularly susceptible to many of the insecticides used on cotton farms ( see table 4 ). the productivity of hives can be damaged by direct or indirect contact with the applied product by foraging bees, or when insecticide drifts over hives or neighbouring vegetation. always look for and follow label directions regarding impact on bees and refer to the protecting pollinators section for more information. sponsored by working with your neighbours. pests and beneficials do not recognise farm boundaries. working with your neighbours to better coordinate planting, farm hygiene and crop spraying can provide benefits for the management of pests such as slw on an area - wide basis. in some regions growers meet regularly at area wide management ( awm ) meetings to discuss pest issues and work towards shared solutions. talk with your nearest cottoninfo regional extension officer ( reo ) about any awm groups in your valley. how do i implement ipm? the great thing",
  "wide management ( awm ) meetings to discuss pest issues and work towards shared solutions. talk with your nearest cottoninfo regional extension officer ( reo ) about any awm groups in your valley. how do i implement ipm? the great thing about ipm is that it does not have to be complicated - it ' s an evolving process that builds on taking practical steps to reduce the survival of pests. for example, a simple first step could be improved on - farm hygiene. this might be followed by a decision to avoid the use of a particular type of disruptive insecticide. see table 1 for examples of activities to consider when planning your ipm program. for first time growers, the easiest way to start your ipm journey is to employ the services of an experienced consultant to help guide you through the process of pest management decision making. a consultant will be able to provide information on what is going on in your crop and advise you on various management options that might be applicable to your situation. for the more experienced manager familiar with pest management principles, consider challenging your boundaries by asking yourself some simple ' why ' questions such as ' why were silverleaf whitefly higher or lower than last season? ' or ' why am i using this particular insecticide? ' the answers might provide insight into the most appropriate next steps for your management program. these types of questions are also good starting points in discussions with your advisor. the important thing about ipm is to appreciate that biological systems are continually evolving along with our knowledge about pest species and control options. keeping up to date with the latest information is essential for effective ipm. the latest research findings are made available to growers and advisors via industry meetings and a range of cottoninfo information products, including this guide. as your ipm program evolves, new practices will bring prospective benefits as well as potential trade - offs ( e. g. the use of a more selective insecticide may cost more to apply than a broad - spectrum option but it reduces the likelihood of secondary pest outbreak which may require further spraying ). the key is to learn as you go, build on the successes that you have, and when things change, be prepared to adapt what you are doing to suit new challenges. useful resources : pest and beneficial insects in australian cotton landscapes. available from www. cottoninfo. com. au cottoninfo videos : what is ipm? https : / / youtu. be / bdqrlx4hn5o ipm in action https : / /",

  "tables 3 and 4 ). allowable usage in the cotton industry ' s insecticide resistance management strategy ( irms ). table 2 : key beneficials and their activity on pest groups always aim to maximise effectiveness against the pest while minimising impact on beneficials. consider other factors such as rate, application technique and other products used in tank mixes that could either improve or hinder efficacy. also consider the potential for unintended consequences such as flaring of non - target pests or increased resistance ( including crossresistance ) in the target or secondary pests. some insecticides are very selective and have little impact on beneficial insects ( often referred to as ' soft ' ), while others are highly disruptive to beneficial populations ( ' broad - spectrum or ' hard ' ). knowing the selectivity of an insecticide helps to assess the risk that following its use, populations of other pests may ' flare ' ( increase rapidly ). the relative selectivity of insecticides available for use in cotton can be found in tables 3 and 4 ( which have been largely based on industry - funded research ). in addition to general impact, table 4 lists the product ' s selectivity to specific types of beneficials. for example, if mealybugs are present, look for insecticides that have less effect on parasitic wasps and key mealybug predators such as lacewings and ladybird beetles. when products are registered for a range of rates, using lower rates may provide sufficient efficacy against some target pests, while minimising impact on beneficials. note that these ratings are based on results after a single application, and multiple applications of a product with a low rank can still have a cumulative disruptive impact. when selecting an insecticide, refer to the irms ( pages 56 - 57 ) to reduce the risk of resistance, and follow the product ' s label directions. cottoninfo video on conserving beneficials https : / / youtu. be / g3gyrt6qon8 y y y cotton pest management guide 2022 - 23 9 insects beneficials sponsored by examples of beneficial species predatory beetles red and blue beetle adult. 5 mm.

( lewis wilson ) sampling aphid populations are sampled visually. focus on non - winged adults and nymphs. winged adults may be transitory, while the presence of nonwinged adults together with their nymphs indicates that a population has settled in the crop. species identification as the different aphid species differ in their potential to damage cotton or spread cbt, identification is important. verify which aphid species is present ( particularly early in the season ) before implementing any management strategies. note that the species composition may change during the season. aphid species can be distinguished by close examination with a hand lens. green peach aphids are pale green and more oval than cotton aphids, and have w - shaped tubercles ( bumps on the head between the antennae ), and long siphunculi ( tubes between the back legs ). cotton aphid and cowpea aphid don ' t have tubercles ( the head is smooth between the antennae ) and the siphunculi are shorter. adults of cowpea aphid are shiny black and nymphs are always sponsored by cgs dusky matt grey, while adults and nymphs of cotton aphid are matt and vary widely from yellow, green, olive, brown to dull black. the siphunculi of adult cotton aphids are always black. if you are unable to make a determination, or suspect more than one species could be present, contact your nearest cotton reo to arrange an identification. contact details are provided at the end of this publication. cottoninfo video on aphid identification https : / / youtu. be / vi07ghsoqtg methods check the population at least weekly : begin aphid sampling at seedling emergence and continue until defoliation. sample for non - winged adults and nymphs on the underside of mainstem leaves 3 - 4 nodes below the plant terminal.",

  "##info video on mirid sampling and thresholds https : / / youtu. be / ik63neuw7ru thresholds economic thresholds are based on when the amount of damage by a given population of pests will exceed the costs ( product and application ) associated with controlling that pest. however this is only an estimate of the true cost of deciding to spray, which includes other costs that may arise later as a result of the control operation ( e. g. the flaring of secondary pests such as silverleaf whitefly ). cheap broad - spectrum products may appear to justify low pest control trigger points, but it may be more cost - effective overall to delay control until mirid numbers are higher and use a more expensive but selective product option. alternatively, the use of a more selective option at a particular pest threshold could be considered on the basis of potential future savings on consequent controls or secondary pest control. a recent review has reconsidered the historical basis for mirid thresholds in the context of modern high - yielding bollgard 3 production systems, allowing existing mirid threshold data to be interpreted in a way that better reflects current economics and production practices. sponsored by these revised thresholds take into account mirid damage and give the user greater flexibility in determining the relative economics of pest control. they are based on thorough sampling twice weekly, the cost of control ( product and application costs / ha ), crop stage and commodity value. for example, previous work suggests that at squaring, the crop will incur a loss of ~ 0. 026 bales / ha / mirid, while at flowering it will incur a loss of ~ 0. 021 - 0. 042 bales / ha / mirid. when the estimated cost of mirid control is $ 45 / ha, and cotton prices are at $ 550 / bale, using a threshold of 3 mirids / m up until flowering aims to prevent an economic yield loss ( see table 9 ). deciding when to spray under field conditions, the link between mirid density and damage is not straightforward. sometimes few mirids seem to be causing a lot of damage, while at other times, large populations of mirids cause little damage. when making a mirid management decision, it is also important to consider : the crop ' s ability to compensate for damage, which varies with the season length and the plant ' s development stage. well - managed crops with optimised agronomic inputs have a very high capacity for compensation to",
  "is also important to consider : the crop ' s ability to compensate for damage, which varies with the season length and the plant ' s development stage. well - managed crops with optimised agronomic inputs have a very high capacity for compensation to overcome fruit loss during squaring, but this reduces as the crop progresses through early flowering. ultimately the capacity for compensation depends on the extent of damage and crop stage, and how these two factors relate to available season length and availability of additional resources such as soil water. regional differences. shorter season areas have a smaller window for crop compensation, particularly after the commencement of flowering. severe early season damage ( tipping and / or fruit loss ) may also cause a maturity delay. in regions with shorter seasons, additional caution may be required when managing mirids e. g. using lower thresholds or higher levels of retention. other factors that may influence the likelihood of mirid damage include the presence and behaviour of beneficials ( predation and disruption of mirid feeding behaviour ), the presence of other pests ( mirids may preferentially feed on insect eggs ), and temperature effects. there are also a range of other factors that might be relevant for mirid management such as nymphal stages, the influence of time of day on sampling accuracy, previous spray history, recent weather events or trends, and the likelihood that secondary pests ( e. g. whitefly or mealybug ) might be flared by ongoing control practices. the first step is to confirm that the damage in the crop is actually caused by mirids ( or other sucking pests ) and not environmental factors. low temperatures can reduce the production of squares by the plant while lack of water, high temperatures, or cloudiness may cause the plant to shed squares. exposure of fruit to high temperatures may cause infertility, resulting in beaked bolls. if dried, brown squares are shed in conjunction with low mirid numbers, it is likely they are shed due to other stresses. in the case of heat stress, shed squares tend to also have a wilted petiole. as bolls develop through the season, it is normal to see black spots on the fruit that are unrelated to mirid damage. cutting the fruit and checking the inner capsule wall for piercing will confirm if the spot was due to mirid feeding or caused by aging. table 9 provides a checklist to assist with making the decision to spray based on economic thresholds. the ' cost of control ' should incorporate not only the cost of the insecticide",
  "if the spot was due to mirid feeding or caused by aging. table 9 provides a checklist to assist with making the decision to spray based on economic thresholds. the ' cost of control ' should incorporate not only the cost of the insecticide and application, but also likely longer term costs, such as triggering other pests and the need for subsequent sprays. each farm will vary in this respect so consider your unique system. cotton pest management guide 2022 - 23 34 insects mirids sponsored by key beneficials damsel bugs and larger lynx spiders, yellow night stalkers and jumping spiders attack mirid adults. these predators also attack smaller instars, as do big - eyed bugs and smaller instars of these spiders. predatory shield bugs may also attack mirids. none of these beneficials are considered to be specialist mirid predators, however their presence can provide an overall reduction of mirid numbers and reduce the survival of developing nymphs. selecting an insecticide insecticide products registered for the control of mirids in cotton in australia are presented in table 10. the use of more selective insecticide options will help to conserve beneficial insects ( see table 4 on pages 14 - 15 ). a lower rate of indoxacarb mixed with salt provides similar efficacy against mirids and stink bugs to the full rate alone but with reduced negative effects on beneficials. a factor to consider when using reduced rates is that residual efficacy might be reduced and if an influx of adults has had time to deposit eggs within the crop, hatching nymphs may escape control and require a follow up treatment 5 - 10 days later, potentially negating any benefits. be cautious when considering reduced rates where populations have built up over time to reach threshold levels, as a mixed population of adults and eggs is more likely to exist compared with treating sudden influxes. cottoninfo video on ' soft ' options for mirids https : / / youtu. be / zmz70fx4v5u resistance profile mirids are not known to have developed resistance to insecticides in australian cotton, however they are difficult to bioassay and so there is currently limited resistance assessment occurring. it is possible that resistance could develop and the principles underlying the irms should be followed in making mirid management decisions. many of the products registered for mirid control in cotton are also registered for the control of other pests. it is critical that mirid management decisions also consider sub - threshold populations of other pests that are present in the field, as application against",

' insurance ' sprays may render pesticides ineffective due to poor application and contribute to resistance buildup. for mixtures to be effective, their components should : be equally persistent ; have different modes of action ( and not be subject to the same routes of metabolic detoxification ) ; not be subject to resistance in the majority of the target pest population ; and, be tank - mix compatible. it is illegal to use rates above those recommended on the label of an insecticide either alone or in mixtures. efficacy will not always improve at rates above the highest label rate or if two insecticides of the same chemical group are applied as a mixture. what to do if you suspect a spray failure carefully assess the situation ( the presence of live pests does not necessarily indicate insecticide failure ). what is the insecticide ' s mode of action? has it been given enough time to work? was it applied correctly and in the right conditions? stomach poisons such as thiodicarb, foliar bt, npv and indoxacarb may not give maximum control until 5 - 7 days after application. similarly, cotton pest management guide 2022 - 23 58 turbo - charge your planter. seedcommand precision placement wide speed range plant on time tool - free maintenance high visibility display seedcommand from ag leader can turn your existing planter into a high - speed precision planter for a fraction of the cost of a new implement. surespeed ® metering ensures perfect singulation and placement at operating speeds from 2 km / h to 19 km / h! sureforce ® hydraulic downforce maintains consistent planting depth in all operating conditions. suredrive ® electric drives reduce overlap and wastage. contact your ag leader dealer today and find out how seedcommand can take your planter to the next level of accuracy and performance. scan here for details or visit seedcommand. com. au ag leader®, ag leader technology®, seedcommand®, suredrive®, sureforce® and surespeed® are registered trademarks of ag leader technology incorporated. ©2022 ag leader technology incorporated. al22138. making farming easier insects resistance propargite, abamectin and dia",

( melina miles, qld daf ) it also has a high fitness cost ( i. e. resistant individuals develop slowly and are more likely to die ) but this disadvantage is unlikely to greatly impact on the development of resistance. at least 2 different forms of resistance to cry1ac have been isolated from field populations of h. punctigera. frequency of both is 1 in 1000 ( 0. 1 % ). cry2ab : a recessive gene that confers high level resistance to cry2ab is present in field populations of h. armigera. the mechanism is likely to be an alteration of a binding site in the gut of the insect. the current estimate of resistance frequency is approximately 3 in 100 ( 3 % ) or less. a recessive gene that confers high level resistance to cry2ab is present in field populations of h. punctigera, and demonstrates the same broad characteristics as the h. armigera cry2ab - resistance, and occurs at a frequency of approximately 1 %. vip3a : at least two different types of vip3a resistance have been identified in both h. armigera and h. punctigera populations. data by csiro and bayer suggests that the frequency of all vip3a resistances is around 1 in 100 ( 1 % ). both csiro and bayer data sets show that there is no significant difference in the frequencies of cry2ab and vip3a resistance alleles over the longer term. irrespective of changes through time, the frequencies of cry2ab and vip3a in h. armigera and h. punctigera are higher than expected and of concern. until the widespread adoption of bt cotton there was presumably little exposure of helicoverpa to this toxin, and therefore minimal selection for resistance. although the cry2ab and vip3a toxins are present in some australian soils, they are not common compared to the cry1ac toxin, yet resistance to the cry1ac toxin in helicoverpa is rare. h. punctigera has the capacity to develop resistance to insecticide sprays but it has been presumed that",

  "cases of bt resistance identified so far, heterozygotes and homozygotes are still controlled by bt cotton. it is crucial that the timing of the production of moths from refuges matches that of bollgard 3 crops. refuge crop areas must be in close proximity to the bollgard 3 crop ( s ) to maximise the likelihood that moths emerging from the bollgard 3 crop will mate with susceptible moths from the nearby refuge crop. during the summer cropping season a significant part of the helicoverpa population may move only a few kilometres, depending on the mix of crops and their attractiveness at the time of moth emergence. therefore the best location for a refuge crop is within 2 km of a bollgard 3 crop, with a road or drain sponsored by adama h. punctigera. ( melina miles, qld daf ) between the two to minimise the movement of large larvae from the refuge to the crop. managing resistance is a population level activity, and every refuge makes an important contribution to both the overall rmp for the valley and, because helicoverpa disperse widely, for the whole industry. it is imperative that all refuges produce their quota of susceptible ( ss ) moths. bayer audits the quality of refuges on every farm that grows bollgard 3 to ensure that they are well maintained and effective. the relative sizes of refuge crops required are based on helicoverpa moth emergence for different crop types, and use a refuge of 10 % unsprayed cotton as an initial reference point for bt crops. on average, pigeon pea produces twice as many moths as the same area of unsprayed cotton, hence only a 5 % refuge of pigeon pea is required. the introduction of bollgard 3 enabled refuge requirements to be reduced to 5 % unsprayed cotton and 2. 5 % pigeon pea, representing the industry ' s confidence in the robustness of a 3 gene product in managing resistance risk combined with an industry commitment to improve the quality of refuges. note that a recent review of the cq system has seen refuge requirements for longer grown crops revert back to bollgard 2 levels. bollgard 3 refuges must be a minimum of 0. 5 ha and at least 24 m wide to account for possible insecticide drift onto the refuge. the productivity of refuges will vary considerably across regions and seasons. improving the production potential of each individual refuge is an integral component of the rmp. growers must ensure that on farm",

  ". broadleaf and grass weeds can be targeted with residual herbicides from groups c ( 5 ), d ( 3 ) or k ( 15 ). most residual herbicides need to be incorporated into the soil for optimum activity. adequate incorporation of some residual herbicides is achieved through rainfall or irrigation, but others require cultivation. soil surfaces that are cloddy or covered in stubble may need some pre - treatment such as light cultivation or burning to prevent ' shading ' during application. ash from burnt stubble may inactivate the herbicide, and therefore must be dissipated with a light cultivation or rainfall prior to herbicide application. crop safety is an important consideration when using residuals. how the herbicide moves in the soil following incorporation will depend on soil type, bed formation, solubility of the herbicide, the ability of the herbicide to bind to the soil and organic matter content, and the volume and timing of rainfall / irrigation, in addition to the method of applying irrigation. growers can influence crop safety by the choice of herbicide, when it is applied, application rate, planting depth, planting date ( to promote rapid crop establishment ) and moisture management. always follow label direction and if you are inexperienced in the use of residuals in cotton you should discuss your circumstances with your consultant, chemical supplier or the manufacturer. the persistence of residual herbicides needs to be considered in order to avoid impacts on rotation crops. persistence is determined by a range of factors including application rate, soil texture, organic matter levels, soil ph, rainfall / irrigation, temperature and the herbicide ' s characteristics. it can be quite complex. for example, it is not usually the volume of rain, but the length of time the soil is moist that is the critical factor. microbes that degrade many herbicides live near the soil surface and require moist soil to flourish. a couple of storms, where the soil surface dries out quickly won ' t contribute as much to residue breakdown as a period of rain that moistens the soil surface for days. refer to product labels for more information. if you suspect that a residual may still be active in the lead up to planting, look for the presence of susceptible weeds in the treated paddock or pot up soil from treated and untreated areas, sow the susceptible crop and compare emergence. where there is a concern, consider planting an alternative crop that is tolerant of the herbicide, or if cotton is to be used, plant the paddock last and pre - irrigate if it is to be",

( linda smith, qld daf ) sponsored by innovate ag extended crop growth late in the season, including through the use of excessive nitrogen, increases the risk of this disease. host range v. dahliae has a large host range and causes vascular wilt on more than 250 plant species including volunteer cotton, ratoon cotton, soybeans, canola, safflower, sunflower, mungbean, chickpea and faba bean. weeds that host the disease include noogoora and bathurst burr, saffron thistle, thornapple, caustic weed, bladder ketmia, burr medic, black bindweed, pigweed, devils claw, turnip weed, mintweed and blackberry nightshade. there is some host specificity between strains. international literature and pot trials with australian strains also suggest that wheat, barley, oats, vetch and maize may be hosts. idm tactics select varieties with a high v rank. manage for earliness, including optimising nutrition and water inputs. avoid over - watering, waterlogging and late season irrigations that extend maturity. minimise tailwater to reduce risk of spread. avoid inter - row cultivation with knives if possible. this causes root damage and provides an entry point for the pathogen. ensure that crop destruction and incorporation occurs soon after picking to reduce the build - up of inoculum. rotate with non - host crops ( i. e. sorghum or maize ). avoid frequent fallows to maintain microbial diversity and populations of beneficial bacteria and fungi. avoid / control alternative hosts, including volunteer and ratoon cotton. send any suspicious plant samples to your state pathologist for correct identification of pathogen. if your farm is free of v. dahliae, try to keep your farm that way. ensure all farm staff and contractors practice good farm hygiene and come clean. go clean. cottoninfo video on verticillium wilt https : / / youtu. be /",

  "the presence ( or imminent likelihood ) of other factors or stresses that may influence canopy expansion ( e. g. temperature, humidity, soil moisture or nitrogen status ) and adjust the timing and rate of applications accordingly. cotton is sensitive to environmental changes and stressed plants will respond differently to mepiquat chloride than crops growing under optimum conditions. note : some defoliant products containing ethephon are labelled as a ' growth regulator '. ethephon is used for preparing the crop for harvest and will cause significant fruit loss if applied to immature crops. for more information refer to chapter 17 of the australian cotton production manual. for cotton production in the tropics, norpak burdekin has detailed mepiquat chloride usage guidelines for wet season production. harvest aids harvest aids can be categorised on mode of action within the plant : defoliants ( e. g. thidiazuron ) impact plant hormonal balances to enhance natural plant senescence and cause the leaves to fall off. activity is highly temperature dependent. desiccants ( e. g. sodium chlorate, paraquat ) dehydrate and kill the leaves within one to several days. they are often used to remove stubborn leaves after defoliation or kill juvenile re - growth. boll openers / conditioners ( e. g. ethephon ) are often applied in tandem with defoliants to enhance boll opening through increased ethylene release and within - plant synthesis that promotes abscission and leads to a quicker separation of boll walls ( carpels ). both the process of crop senescence and the plant ' s response to applied harvest aids are heavily influenced by plant and environmental factors. cotton leaves naturally senesce ( detach and fall off when they get old ), but a cotton plant would not normally defoliate ( lose all its leaves at once ). the application of defoliants to induce senescence is therefore a key component of harvest management. artificially - induced defoliation ideally enables leaf separation while the leaf remains green, with the fresh ' weight ' of the leaf helping it reach the ground and reducing the potential for leaf trash in harvested modules. rapid leaf trauma from desiccation ( such as caused by frost or herbicide ) usually kills the leaf blade before the leaf drops, which can result in dead leaves remaining in the canopy. boll opening is a largely mechanical process of dehydration of the boll wall, causing the boll to split open",
  "herbicide ) usually kills the leaf blade before the leaf drops, which can result in dead leaves remaining in the canopy. boll opening is a largely mechanical process of dehydration of the boll wall, causing the boll to split open and unfurl. leaf removal exposes bolls to more direct sunlight, promoting increased temperatures for maturation, and drying and cracking of the boll walls. only consider using boll conditioning / opener products if the bolls that will be forced open are mature ; if applied prior to boll maturation they may cause bolls to shed and reduce yield. the safe timing for defoliation is when the youngest boll expected to reach harvest is physiologically mature. this usually occurs when 60 - 65 % of bolls are open. desiccants dry all plant parts ( including stems ), potentially increasing the trash content of harvested lint. avoid them unless conditions do not enable the effective use of defoliants ( e. g. very cold weather ). desiccants are also a reliable method to reduce leaf regrowth. high rates of some defoliants can act as desiccants. wetting agents and spray adjuvants ( e. g. paraffinic oil, non - ionic surfactants or petroleum oil ) are used to assist with defoliation as cool temperatures, low humidity and water stress prior to defoliant application can result in increased wax and thickness of the leaf cuticle, reducing the efficiency of chemical uptake. improving defoliation product performance in addition to timing, it is important to consider product, rate and application issues. if product rates are too high, the plant material may die before releasing enough ethylene to cause defoliation, resulting instead in leaf desiccation ( leaf death ). temperature plays a critical role ( warmer conditions improve crop response ), so defoliate before the onset of frost. apply defoliants during the day when conditions are warmer to assist uptake. avoid application if there is a risk of rainfall shortly afterwards. plants that are naturally beginning to senesce as the bolls mature will be much more responsive to applied defoliants than plants that are either not in decline or showing signs of continued growth. aim to encourage senescence by having soil moisture at refill just prior to defoliation and avoid excessive nitrogen application. crops that are ' navy ' green at maturity ( as opposed to those showing signs of leaf aging and senescence ) are more difficult to defoli",
