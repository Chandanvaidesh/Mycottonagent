<text><loc_71><loc_60><loc_442><loc_115>Cotton  is  one  of  the  most  important  fiber  and  cash  crop  of  India  and  plays  a dominant role in  the  industrial  and  agricultural  economy  of  the  country.  It  provides  the basic raw material (cotton fibre) to cotton textile industry. Cotton in India provides direct livelihood to  6  million  farmers  and  about  40  -50  million  people  are  employed  in  cotton trade and its processing.</text>
<text><loc_71><loc_133><loc_442><loc_213>In  India,  there  are  ten  major  cotton  growing  states  which  are  divided  into  three zones,  viz.  north  zone,  central  zone  and  south  zone.  North  zone  consists  of  Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan. Central zone includes Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat. South zone comprises Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka  and Tamil Nadu. Besides these ten States, cotton cultivation has gained momentum in the Eastern State of Orissa. Cotton  is  also  cultivated  in  small  areas  of  non-traditional  States  such  as  Uttar  Pradesh, West Bengal & Tripura.</text>

<text><loc_71><loc_250><loc_442><loc_355>There are four cultivated species of cotton viz. Gossypium arboreum , G.herbaceum , G.hirsutum and G.barbadense .  The  first  two  species  are  diploid  (2n=26) and  are  native  to  old  world.  They  are  also  known  as  Asiatic  cottons  because  they  are grown in Asia. The last two species are tetraploid (2n=52) and are also referred to as New World  Cottons. G.hirsutum is  also  known  as  American  cotton  or  upland  cotton  and G.barbadense as  Egyptian  cotton  or  Sea  Island  cotton  or  Peruvian  Cotton  or  Tanguish Cotton or quality cotton. G.hirsutum is  the  predominant  species which alone contributes about 90% to the global production. Perhaps, India is the only country in the world where all the four cultivated species are grown on commercial scale.</text>

<section_header_level_1><loc_71><loc_391><loc_225><loc_398>6. Climate & Soil Requirement</section_header_level_1>
<text><loc_71><loc_410><loc_438><loc_453><loc_71><loc_44><loc_438><loc_63>Cotton,  a  semi-xerophyte,  is  grown  in  tropical  &  sub  tropical  conditions.  A minimum temperature of 15 o C is required for better germination at field conditions. The optimum temperature for vegetative growth is 21-27 o C & it can tolerate temperature to the extent of 43 o C but temperature below 21 o C is detrimental to the crop. Warm days of cool  nights  with  large  diurnal  variations  during  the  period  of  fruiting  are  conducive  to good boll & fibre development.</text>
<page_break>
<text><loc_71><loc_69><loc_438><loc_112>Cotton is grown on a variety of soils ranging from well drained deep alluvial soils in  the  north  to  black  clayey  soils  of  varying  depth  in  central  region  and  in  black  and mixed black and red soils in south zone.  Cotton is semi-tolerant to salinity and sensitive to water logging and thus prefers well drained soils.</text>
<section_header_level_1><loc_71><loc_130><loc_156><loc_136>7. Crop Season</section_header_level_1>
<text><loc_71><loc_146><loc_438><loc_299>The  sowing  season  of  cotton  varies  considerably  from  tract  to  tract  and  is generally early (April-May) in northern India and is delayed as we proceed to down south (monsoon  based  in  southern  zone).    Cotton  is  a  Kharif  crop  in  the  major  parts  of  the country  viz.  Punjab,  Haryana,  Rajasthan,  Uttar  Pradesh,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Gujarat, Maharashtra and parts of Andhra Pradesh & Karnataka.  In these areas, the irrigated crop is sown from March-May and the rain fed crop in June-July with the commencement of the  monsoon.    In  Tamil  Nadu,  the  major  portion  of  the  irrigated  and  rain  fed  crop  is planted in September-October, whereas the sowing of the rain fed crop in the southern districts is extended up to November.  In parts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, the desi cotton is usually sown in August-September.  In addition, summer sowings in Tamil Nadu are done during February-March.  The sowings of cotton in the rice fallows of Andhra Pradesh  and  Tamil  Nadu  extent  from  the  second  half  of  December  to  the  middle  of January.</text>
<section_header_level_1><loc_71><loc_318><loc_189><loc_324>8. Preparation of land</section_header_level_1>
<text><loc_71><loc_330><loc_438><loc_373>The time available for land preparation following the harvest of wheat is limited in the north zone.  Pre-sowing irrigation is undertaken after the harvest of wheat. The land is worked upon with tractor-drawn implements, then levelled & planked before preparing ridges upon which sowing is done.</text>
<text><loc_71><loc_379><loc_438><loc_435>In  central  and  southern  zone  of  India  where  cotton  is  a  rainfed  crop,  deep ploughing  recommended  to  destroy  perennial  weeds  once  in  4  years.    The  field  is prepared by repeated harrowing with a blade harrow prior to  the onset of pre-monsoon rains. Sowing is undertaken on ridges & furrows in drylands for moisture conservation & weed management.</text>

<section_header_level_1><loc_71><loc_44><loc_181><loc_50>9. Method of sowing</section_header_level_1>
<text><loc_71><loc_57><loc_442><loc_100>Cotton  is  sown  using  tractor  or  bullock  drawn  seed  drill  or  by  dibbling.  Hand dibbling  of  seeds  at  recommended  spacing  is  commonly  practiced  in  rainfed  areas particularly  for  hybrids.  This  system  ensures  proper  plant  stand,  uniform  geometry  and also saves seeds. This is now main system of sowing of Bt. Hybrids. Cotton cultivation on ridges across the slopes conserves more water, reduces soil erosion and improves yield.</text>
<section_header_level_1><loc_71><loc_120><loc_194><loc_127>10. Irrigation Scheduling</section_header_level_1>
<text><loc_71><loc_133><loc_438><loc_164>Depending upon the climate & crop-growing period, cotton needs 700-1,200 mm water to meet its maximum water requirement. The water requirement is low during first 60-70 days after sowing & highest during flowering & boll development.</text>
<text><loc_71><loc_183><loc_438><loc_250>Cotton  is  commonly  flood  irrigated  although  irrigation  by  furrow  or  alternate furrow method is more effective and water saving.  Drip irrigation is becoming popular particularly in the hybrids for central and southern zones.  Cotton needs to be irrigated at 50-70% depletion of available soil moisture.  On sandy loam soils of northern zone 3-5 irrigations are commonly given. On red sandy loam soils of Tamil Nadu with low water retention capacity, 4-13 light irrigations may be necessary.</text>

<section_header_level_1><loc_71><loc_232><loc_241><loc_238>12. Inter cultivation & weed control</section_header_level_1>
<text><loc_71><loc_247><loc_442><loc_281>Inter-cultivation is done fairly regularly by either a blade harrow with a three tined hoe or a desi plough.   In the crop sown by broadcasting, one or two hand hoeing's are given  to  remove  weeds,  inter-cultivation  not  only  checks  the  growth  of  weeds  but  also leads to better soil aeration and soil moisture conservation.</text>
<text><loc_71><loc_294><loc_445><loc_350>Weeds  compete  with  cotton  crop  for  nutrients,  light  and  moisture.    Cotton  is susceptible to weed competition from sowing to about 70 days when the canopy covers the inter-spaces.    Cotton  yields  are  reduced  by  50  to  85%  if  weed  growth  is  unchecked. Fluchloralin  or  pendimethalin  @  1  kg  ai/ha.  as  pre-plant  incorporation  with  one  hand weeding and crosswise hoeing has been recommended for satisfactory weed control.  Deep rooted perennial weeds are removed by summer ploughing.</text>
<text><loc_71><loc_360><loc_437><loc_394>The thinning  of  the  cotton  crop  is  a  special  feature  of  the  irrigated  crop  sown  on ridges  in  Peninsular  India  and  in  parts  of  southern  Gujarat.  Thinning  is  desirable  for maintaining the optimum population of plants to obtain a high yield.  During thinning, the vigorous seedlings are retained and weak seedlings and off types are removed.</text>

<text><loc_71><loc_365><loc_438><loc_456><loc_71><loc_44><loc_438><loc_69>Government  of  India  launched  a  Centrally  Sponsored  Scheme  of  Technology Mission on Cotton (TMC) during 2000. Mini Mission-II (MM-II) of TMC was on cotton development with the aim to increase the production & productivity of cotton. MM-II of TMC  was  implemented  by  the  Department  of  Agriculture,  Cooperation  &  Farmers Welfare  (DAC&FW)  in  13  States  viz.  Andhra  Pradesh,  Gujarat,  Haryana,  Karnataka, Madhya  Pradesh,  Maharashtra,  Orissa,  Punjab,  Rajasthan,  Tamil  Nadu,  Uttar  Pradesh, West  Bengal  and  Tripura  from  2000-01  to  2013-14.  The  sharing  of  funding  of  the components was 75:25 between Central and State Governments. However, in some of the components implemented by ICAR/ other central agencies, 100 per cent share was borne by the Central Government. Under the scheme, assistance was provided for transfer of technologies  through  field  demonstrations,  training  of  farmers  &  extension  workers  as well as supply of critical inputs such as certified seeds, pheromone traps, bio-agents & water saving devices like sprinklers & drip irrigation system, etc.</text>
