<text><loc_59><loc_103><loc_178><loc_260>Machines to form cotton modules at the site of harvest solved the serious problem of harvest being delayed by ginning capacity. A primary advantage of seed cotton modules has been the decoupling of the harvesting and ginning operations. By forming modules that can be stored in the field, harvest can continue when crop condition and weather allow, regardless of the ginning rate. Changes in the cotton ginning industry have resulted in modules exposed to inclement weather</text>
<picture><loc_189><loc_102><loc_441><loc_248></picture>
<text><loc_59><loc_264><loc_422><loc_279>for longer periods of time. The consolidation of the ginning industry has meant fewer gins with larger service areas, and thus a longer ginning season.</text>
<section_header_level_1><loc_59><loc_299><loc_198><loc_306>Protection Against Weather</section_header_level_1>
<text><loc_59><loc_315><loc_444><loc_359>If not well protected, exposing seed cotton to weather can reduce both producer and ginner profits. Rain damages cotton by increasing moisture content, reducing color grade, causing rot and heating in the module. These avoidable quality changes affect the price received by the producer, as well as increasing the cost of ginning because of increased drying energy and reduced ginning rate. Wind can blow cotton from exposed modules, resulting in less salable lint and seed.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_126><loc_238><loc_179>For many years, trailers were the primary method of moving harvested cotton from the field to the cotton gin. Until the mid-1940s, cotton was primarily hand harvested and there was a limited effect of trailer capacity on timeliness of harvesting.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_189><loc_237><loc_223>The advent of mechanical harvesting significantly increased the harvesting capacity and made trailers the limiting factor in the harvesting-ginning system. Larger and</text>
<picture><loc_254><loc_124><loc_441><loc_215></picture>
<text><loc_59><loc_226><loc_440><loc_261>increased numbers of trailers and the gradual increase in ginning capacity could not keep up with harvesting capacity. Thus harvesters would sit idle until cotton was ginned from trailers and made available to the producer. This extended the harvest season, exposing cotton remaining in the field to undesirable weather conditions that resulted in yield and quality losses.</text>
<section_header_level_1><loc_59><loc_280><loc_157><loc_288>The Module Builder</section_header_level_1>
<text><loc_59><loc_297><loc_443><loc_350>The need for an improved storing and transporting system led to the development in the early 1970s of the module builder. This was a system in which cotton was dumped from the harvester into the module builder and the cotton compacted into a trapezoidal shape. Initially, modules were built on pallets made of either wood or metal. Further studies found that the cotton modules could be formed and stored directly on the ground without significant loss of cotton quantity or quality, so long as the ground surface was well drained.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_359><loc_441><loc_412>A method of hauling the modules from the field to the gin was also developed. Initial haulers used tilting beds with rollers and a winch that pulled the pallets onto the truck. Modules built without pallets allowed the use of systems similar to those for hay bales. This included a series of parallel chains built into the tilting bed. The chains were synchronized to the ground speed of the truck when loading and unloading the module. The module truck provided a method for transporting the modules at higher speeds and longer distances.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_422><loc_436><loc_447>When cotton moduling systems were initially adopted, the gins were not adequately equipped to break up the modules. The suction system used to unload trailers was slow and ineffective when feeding compressed seed cotton from modules. Early systems utilized either stationary or moving</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_69><loc_234><loc_103>heads that used several cylinders with lugs to remove the cotton from the compacted module, dropping the seed cotton onto belts or into pneumatic conveying systems.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_112><loc_239><loc_185>Taken as a system, the module builder, transporter and feeder represented a revolutionary change in the way cotton was handled between the field and gin. The module system was adopted rapidly wherever cotton was mechanically harvested, because it provided significant operational efficiencies, both for harvesting and ginning operations.</text>
<section_header_level_1><loc_59><loc_204><loc_213><loc_211>Module System Improvements</section_header_level_1>
<text><loc_59><loc_220><loc_242><loc_349>The initial module system concept evolved with many changes and improvements. The module builder used in the United States has kept the standard 7.5-foot wide by 32-foot base dimensions. Module builder height can vary from 9 feet- 6 inches to 11 feet, with the more common height being 11 feet. The choice of heights depends on other equipment used in the harvesting system. Additional improvements have been in hydraulic systems, operator controls, expanded wire sides to allow air to escape during dumping, and cabs for operators. A modern module builder is illustrated in Figure 1 .</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_359><loc_444><loc_412>The biggest change since the early development of the module builder has been larger capacity cotton harvesters. Harvester operating width gradually increased from 2-row to 4-row and then to 6-row and 8-row. The wider multi-row units cannot dump directly into module builders because of the header width. To accommodate the wider machines and keep the expensive harvesters working, a system of using carts, known as boll buggies, was developed to transport the harvested cotton from the field to the module builders that were typically located at the edge of the field.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_421><loc_438><loc_455>The boll buggy ( Figure 2 ) pulled by a tractor follows the harvester through the field until the basket on the harvester is full. The boll buggy pulls along the side of the harvester, receives cotton dumped from the harvester basket, and transports the load to the module builder. This separation of the harvest and transport functions allows the more expensive harvester to spend more time</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_69><loc_439><loc_122>harvesting. Some harvesters and boll buggies are equipped with live chain drags on the side of the baskets so that, when tilted up for dumping, the cotton can be dumped in a more controlled manner. As more of the cotton crop was stored in modules, the need to maintain the quality of the seed cotton became apparent. Seed cotton modules are protected by placing a water-resistant cover over the top surface of the module. Early covers were made of canvas, but were gradually replaced by coated plastic materials because of lighter weight and lower cost.</text>
<section_header_level_1><loc_59><loc_142><loc_171><loc_149>Recent Developments</section_header_level_1>
<text><loc_59><loc_158><loc_429><loc_221>Engineering efforts to develop a cotton picker that would also form modules started in the late 1970s and early '80s, but it was not until 2007-09 that these systems became commercially available. Both U.S. cotton picker manufacturers sell harvesters that will compact the harvested cotton into a module. The Case IH machine makes a 16-foot-long unit (a 'half module') that requires covering after unloading. The John Deere cotton picker forms seed cotton into a round module shape of about one quarter of the weight of a convention module, and surrounds that module with a plastic film that forms the cover.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_230><loc_440><loc_274>These machines represent further efforts to enhance the efficiency of the cotton harvest operation. By performing both harvest and module forming operations, these machines can eliminate the need for boll buggies, module builders, tractors and labor. Accomplishing these efficiencies required compromises, however. These machines form smaller modules and have a significantly higher initial cost than conventional cotton pickers.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_283><loc_173><loc_412>While these new machines produce different module shapes and sizes compared to conventional modules, the need to maintain the seed cotton quality in the package remains. Figure 3 shows conventional modules, half modules and round modules together in a gin yard. The image was taken following a rainstorm, and water can be seen collected on the top of some modules.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_103><loc_435><loc_147>With the advent of the on-board module builders on cotton pickers, growers now have an option for how to package their seed cotton for storage and transport. However, the need to protect the cotton through good practices remains the same. Some of these practices are the responsibility of the grower or his harvest crew, and some should be performed by the ginner. The following sections describe the unique factors for each module type.</text>
<section_header_level_1><loc_59><loc_167><loc_175><loc_174>Conventional Modules</section_header_level_1>
<text><loc_59><loc_183><loc_437><loc_246>The conventional practice in the U.S. is to form modules at the edge of the field using a module builder that creates 32-foot-long modules with a trapezoidal cross-section. Similar builders are used internationally where cotton is mechanically harvested, but the dimensions of the forming chamber may vary by country. After forming, the modules must be protected from the weather. Protective covers for the conventional module are available in a range of styles, materials and prices. Design differences include the material used in the top surface, skirt design (shape, depth and material), the presence of tie-down loops on the side skirts, and type of closure (rope, belt, etc.).</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_281><loc_180><loc_439>The modules formed by the Case IH Module Express cotton picker are 16 feet long, rectangular and trapezoidal in cross-section. Those modules are protected with a cover similar to conventional modules but shorter in length. The number of manufacturers selling covers designed for these half-length modules initially has been limited; but with an increase in the number of Module Express cotton pickers used, the options of manufacturers and models are expected to increase as well.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_69><loc_439><loc_103>The considerations for selection between those offerings are similar to those of conventional module covers.

<text><loc_59><loc_126><loc_439><loc_160>The negative impact of weathering on seed cotton is well recognized. Studies have shown changes in color when seed cotton moisture is increased. Curley, et al. (1987) found that most of the coloring effect was due to yellowing. The yellowing was primarily affected by moisture content, days stored, average air temperature during storage and initial temperature of the cotton module.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_169><loc_439><loc_222>Moisture contents above 14 percent moisture sharply increased yellowing. As seed cotton moisture increased from 13 to 16 percent, there was a marked decrease in seed germination, and for seed cotton moisture contents above 16 percent, the seed would not germinate. Although increased levels of seed moisture caused a slight reduction in percent oil, there was negligible effect on oil quality index and percent oil as affected by seed cotton moisture content or other storage variables.</text>
<section_header_level_1><loc_59><loc_242><loc_187><loc_249>Damaged Module Covers</section_header_level_1>
<text><loc_59><loc_258><loc_438><loc_293><loc_59><loc_296><loc_154><loc_444>In practice, module covers are sometimes considered usable as long as they don't have large rips or tears in the surface. However, breakdown of the water-resistant coating can seriously degrade protection of the seed cotton. Used module covers were obtained from gin inventories and tested under laboratory conditions at Texas A&M University. The covers were evaluated on a light table and categorized based on the condition and number of visible pinholes. Samples were exposed to simulated rainfall in a standardized test, and the amount of water penetrating the cover samples was measured. The water penetration increased from a near zero level with new covers to an excessive amount for those covers rated as abused.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_69><loc_434><loc_113>Figure 6 shows how the water penetration rates would affect the moisture content of the top two feet of a module during a four-hour rainstorm. The moisture content of the cotton was assumed to be 10% prior to the rainfall. The chart illustrates that even a moderately used cover (one that typically would be considered 'ok') will allow the moisture content to increase to levels that will cause grade reductions.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_148><loc_431><loc_211>The impact of poorly protected seed cotton modules can be observed in the gin when modules are exposed to significant rainfall. In the 2004 harvest season on the Texas High Plains, a period of good harvest weather was followed by several days of rain with no wind. Large numbers of modules were formed prior to the weather event, and were exposed to the weather while stored in the fields. This situation allowed the comparison of lint grades and ginning performance for modules formed and ginned before the weather event to those formed before the weather but ginned afterward (Simpson and Searcy, 2005).</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_220><loc_436><loc_264><loc_59><loc_268><loc_169><loc_340>Prior to ginning, observations were made by gin personnel to evaluate individual modules for shape (good or poor) and the ages of the cover used (3 years or less = 'good,' more than 3 years = 'poor'). The three-year age was a rough indicator of the cover's ability to resist moisture penetration. A module shape was judged as good if the module was full sized and had a flat- to crowned-top surface. With these assessments of the module shape and cover quality, the impact of weathering for various conditions was evaluated. With a total of 137 modules and 1967 bales observed, the study provided a 'real world' assessment of the economic impact of module protection practices.</text>

In well-formed modules with good quality covers, there was no change in lint grade and value between those ginned before and after the weather event. When comparing the total module value to those with no rain exposure, building a well-formed module prevented about $200 loss, and using a high-quality cover prevented a loss of about $400. These losses are completely avoidable with adequate protection of the seed cotton.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_84><loc_245><loc_213>Covering modules can be a difficult task, especially when the wind is blowing. Crews use various methods. Some will unroll the cover on top of the module while the module is still in the builder, others will attach the cover to the rear door of the builder so that the cover is dragged over the module as the builder is moved off, and others will use a ladder to climb on top of a free-standing module to spread the cover. A preferred method is to use the module builder door to pull the cover over the module while moving the builder off the module ( Figure 13 ). This method avoids the need for a worker to be on top of the module, but requires covering the</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_217><loc_441><loc_232>module immediately at the time of building. A covering crew that works independent of the module forming will have to use ladders to place the cover on the top of the larger modules.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_242><loc_442><loc_304>Whichever method is used, avoid walking on the cover after it is spread on top of a module. Walking on the cover after installation can cause puddles and water penetration even if the cover is in excellent condition. The cover should be pulled as low as possible on the module on both ends. Lower attachment points will help to avoid standing water on the surface and make the cover less susceptible to wind damage or removal. When tightening the cover onto the module, do not tie hard knots in the belt or rope. If using tie-downs on the side of the cover, use module twine, not plastic or baler twine.</text>

The instrument console provides an indicator of the size of the module being formed as a percentage of the recommended size. In most cases, the module size will not be 100 percent of recommended size as the picker reaches the turn row. For this reason, the operator must decide to unload a less than full-sized module, or to continue picking and have to deadhead back to the turn row when the module is complete. These decisions can have a significant influence on the operating efficiency of the harvester. For more information on unloading half-size modules, see 'The Spindle Type Cotton Harvester' publication.</text>

While some operators have tried to stage two modules together, this often means driving to the location of a previously unloaded module. Staging together is not a requirement, as module truck drivers can pick up a single half-length module, drive to the next module and pick it up as well. These separate actions require a higher level of skill on the part of the module truck driver, and so problems with module damage can occur with inexperienced drivers.

<text><loc_59><loc_139><loc_434><loc_202>The practices used for installing conventional covers are also appropriate for the half-length modules. Because of the smaller size, and often shorter modules, half-length covers are easier to apply. Because of the auger mechanism used in the compression chamber of the Module Express picker, the half-length modules have a tendency to have depressions along the length of the module that can collect water during storage. To minimize the potential for water collection, it is important to pull the cover down over the module as much as possible. A loose top surface is more likely to collect water that could potentially penetrate into the seed cotton.</text>

The module-forming control system handles the wrapping of the modules; and, when wrapping is completed, the module is ejected onto the carrier at the rear of the machine, as shown in Figure 16 .</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_258><loc_429><loc_302>The primary action of the operator regarding the modules is to decide when to drop the module being carried. Typically, the finished module is carried until it can be dropped on a turn-row.

This action has no impact on the operation of the picker, but stalks may puncture or tear the plastic wrap.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_337><loc_434><loc_391>Because of the round shape of the modules, there is a concern about dropping the modules on sloping ground. When the carrier is lowered for unloading, the modules do roll onto the ground. Typically, there is enough flexing of the module shape that the rolling stops very quickly. However, there is a potential for continued rolling if the module were dropped when the picker is headed up a steep slope. In rolling terrain, the operator should drop the modules only when the picker is oriented across the slope to prevent excessive rolling.</text>

The most common system is to use a set of forks with hydraulically controlled spacing mounted on the three-point hitch of a tractor ( Figure 17 ). Other devices include a mast-type mounted implement that holds the module with the axis parallel to the tractor rear axle or a set of forks on a front-end loader. Because the round modules can weigh over 6,000 lbs., a large tractor is required for staging. The following practices are recommended when unloading and preparing modules for transport:</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_169><loc_440><loc_204>The plastic wrap typically performs well in preventing moisture from entering the seed cotton. The open ends of the modules will shed rainwater, provided the ends are not touching. Modules too close together will hold water between the ends, resulting in wet cotton with the usual potential for reduced-quality grades. When intact, the wrap will shed water on the circumference of the module.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_213><loc_443><loc_276>Punctures and tears in the wrap can occur and will allow degradation of the seed cotton if not repaired. Tears can be covered with a water-resistant tape, such as lint bale repair tape. A common problem is that the adhesive at the end of the wrap gives way after weathering, resulting in loose ends. John Deere recommends reattaching the loose end with 3M 90 spray adhesive or lint bale repair tape. Wrap damage should be repaired before transport, as the loading/unloading actions can make damage more serious. The inside walls of the module truck must be free of burrs or edges that could catch and tear the wrap during loading.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_325><loc_439><loc_378>From early days of forming seed cotton modules, protection of the module was recognized as necessary while waiting to be ginned. Canvas was used to cover the earliest modules, and the importance of that protection was demonstrated by the development of a standard for cotton modules that included the performance and design of canvas covers (ASAE, 1997). While modern covers are no longer made of canvas, the importance of preventing moisture from entering the seed cotton is still recognized.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_414><loc_440><loc_448>Covers for conventional modules are manufactured from a variety of materials that resist water penetration. All modern covers are made of a plastic material (typically polyethylene), either as a film or woven from tapes of differing sizes. The woven fabrics may be coated on either one or both sides, and the coatings can be polyethylene or polyvinyl chloride.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_219><loc_421><loc_282>The top surface can be formed in various ways, depending on the manufacturer. Most covers manufactured today do not have seams in the top surface, because of the potential for leaks. Any seams in the top surface of laminated, coated fabrics should be heat sealed to minimize leakage. Manufacturers often offer a range of colors for the top surface. Color does not make a difference in performance in most regions of the Cotton Belt. The exception would be south Texas, where the more intense solar radiation in the summer harvest period would encourage the use of lighter colored tops.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_318><loc_424><loc_371>Plastic mesh netting is sometimes used instead of module covers to limit wind losses in the more arid cotton producing areas, as it is assumed that the modules will not be exposed to rain. The netting primarily serves to prevent loss of seed cotton during periods of high winds, but provides no protection from water. Most gin managers prefer the mesh netting not to be used, as the modules are exposed to possible moisture damage. The netting is also difficult to remove at the module feeder and presents a disposal problem for the gin.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_407><loc_428><loc_451>Skirts (the vertical portion of the cover extending down the side of the module) are available in a variety of forms. Module skirts can be fitted or open-ended. The material on the ends of the cover is typically the same as the top surface. The skirts can be made of coated fabric (typically of a lighter weight than the top) or a mesh fabric. The mesh is preferred in regions where seed cotton moisture and cool morning air can cause condensation on the underside of the</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_69><loc_426><loc_103>cover. With the mesh sides, air flow is enhanced across the module top to dry and remove the moisture. Manufacturers offer the side skirts in both straight and V shapes. The V shape skirt is considered by some users to be better than the straight sided skirt because they tend to stay on the modules better during high wind conditions.</text>
<section_header_level_1><loc_59><loc_123><loc_196><loc_130>Belts and Tie-Down Loops</section_header_level_1>
<text><loc_59><loc_139><loc_424><loc_183>Module covers include a method for firmly attaching the cover to the module. Ropes and belts are the common methods of holding module covers on the modules. They are enclosed in sleeves sewn around the bottom of the cover skirt that allows the rope or belt to slip as they are pulled tight. Adequate tension on the rope or belt is necessary to keep the cover on the module during windy conditions.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_192><loc_284><loc_302>Some cover designs have two tensioning points: at the bottom of the skirt and midway up the skirt. Flat belts normally utilize buckles for maintaining tension ( Figure 19 ). Ropes are provided with rings that can be used to tie off the tension. It is important that the knots for ropes and buckles for belts are easily untied and unbuckled and do not need to be cut for removal. Use only slip knots when tying ropes. When the module is exposed to wind, the cover will raise off the module, tightening the belt or rope, which will cause any knots to become extremely tight and compressed. In this situation, gin workers will typically cut the belt or rope in the interest of saving time. Properly</text>

The extra length of rope or belt remaining after tying or belting should be placed inside the module cover to prevent entangling in the module truck or module feeder.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_376><loc_425><loc_429>The belt or rope alone may not be adequate to keep the cover on the module. In very high wind situations, additional ties over the top of the module can be used. Some cover designs include tie-down points (such as loops or grommets) in an effort to prevent high winds from tearing the fabric, or removing the cover from the module completely. These additional ties are either placed under the module before it is formed, or forced through the middle of the module when the cover is applied.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_376><loc_442><loc_420>Module covers have a limited life, and should not be used beyond that period. That life is limited by the damage that occurs to the cover, compromising its ability to resist water penetration. Damage can occur from multiple factors, and understanding the impact of the damage sources can aid in the management of an inventory of covers. As was shown earlier, even covers with moderate use can result in seed cotton moisture levels high enough to lose significant value.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_283><loc_238><loc_450>Prolonged exposure to UV rays causes a significant breakdown of the protective coating on module covers. This exposure increases with time (the number of days on a module in storage), and solar radiation intensity (more severe in the summer and early fall months). Significant UV exposure causes the coating to weaken and allows pinholes to form. Since this breakdown does not cause large defects, such as rips or large holes, covers are often kept in service well past the time when the coating is able to resist moisture penetration. Figure 21 shows coating particles that have broken from the cover and fallen onto the seed cotton. These coating flakes are a potential form of contamination of the cotton. Covers should be thrown away well before a situation like this occurs.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_84><loc_281><loc_204>Wind can have a significant effect on module covers in two ways. At lower speeds, wind causes the cover fabric to flap. Flapping causes the cover to bend and flex, resulting in a breakdown of the protective coating similar to that caused by exposure to UV rays. In fact, it is often not possible to distinguish which of these sources is the cause of cover damage. Since weather exposure includes both solar radiation and wind, both contribute to the gradual breakdown of the coating. When the wind is very high, the damage can be dramatic and catastrophic, such as when the base fabric of the cover rips along a seam or other stress points ( Figure 22 ).</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_213><loc_439><loc_276>Module exposure to wind varies greatly across the Cotton Belt. Wind concerns are not great in California and Arizona, but significant wind damage often occurs in the Texas High Plains and Oklahoma. Severe weather in the High Plains is often related to passing weather fronts that generate wind speeds greater than 50 mph. Such high winds cause intense strains on the module cover, which results in torn covers and broken tie-down straps. Complete removal of the tarp can result in seed cotton blowing off the module and wetting of the seed cotton in the module if rain also occurs.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_285><loc_437><loc_320>The Texas Gulf Coast, Mid-South and the Southeast can be subject to long periods of high winds during hurricanes and tropical storms. These areas are also subject to long periods of rainfall that have resulted in significantly increased moisture in the module. It is best to build modules with the length of module parallel to the predominant wind direction.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_349><loc_443><loc_421>Weathering tests have shown a wide range of performance by module covers. Extended UV exposure has demonstrated that vinyl and film covers retain high moisture resistance after four years of summer months' exposure. The performance of coated, woven polyethylene covers has varied from high resistance (similar to the vinyl and film covers) to rapid degradation within a single season of exposure (Simpson and Searcy, 2008). Limited testing of cover samples in a wind tunnel has shown similar variability for the coated woven covers and high performance for the vinyl covers. The film cover does not perform well in high winds, as the stresses generated by the wind's force cause the film to rip.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_84><loc_439><loc_128>Covers vary in price from approximately $65 to $125 each. As with many products, higher performing covers generally have a higher price. However, the cost of even the highest price cover is less than the lint value that was lost due to poor covers in the 2004 High Plains storm event. Vinyl covers generally have the highest cost, but perform consistently well in a wide range of conditions. They have the disadvantage of being significantly heavier than the other cover types.</text>
<text><loc_59><loc_137><loc_442><loc_200>Film covers are more moderately priced, lighter weight and most suitable for regions where high winds are not expected but significant rainfall occurs. Coated woven covers have the widest range of prices and performance. The better performing models are suitable for all regions of the Cotton Belt, but purchasers should ask for performance histories of the models when making purchasing decisions. No performance standard exists today that can be used to judge the relative performance of available covers. Information for making purchase decisions is available from the cover manufacturers.</text>

<text><loc_59><loc_236><loc_442><loc_327>Inspection of covers should occur both in-season and at the end of the ginning season. Typically, covers are used on three to five modules per season, and each time a cover is removed from a module at the feeder, an inspection should occur. Typical practice is to lay the cover out on the floor near the feeder, fold it over to 1/3 of the width and roll it up using a powered or manual roller. Train feeder employees to observe the cover and look for larger defects such as rips, failed seams, or holes in the top surface and an inoperable belt or rope. If such defects exist, that cover should be placed in a 'Do not use' pile to prevent that cover from going out onto another module. Those covers can be inspected for possible repair at the end of the season. Inspecting for pinholes and coating degradation is not feasible during the season because of the time required for an adequate assessment.</text>
<section_header_level_1><loc_59><loc_341><loc_178><loc_347>End of Season Inspection</section_header_level_1>
<text><loc_59><loc_356><loc_438><loc_419>Following the end of the ginning season, inspect the covers more thoroughly to determine if they are suitable for use in the next season. One simple means of determining which covers should be removed from the inventory is to use age as a determining factor. The manufacturing date shown on the label can be used to identify covers too old (a common age limit is three years) to be used again. Inspection and repair can be done by gin employees or by companies that specialize in cover inspection and repair. In addition to the larger defects that can be observed, the cover should be placed on a rack or light table that will allow light to pass through any pinholes in the coating.</text>

<list_item><loc_59><loc_198><loc_435><loc_214>When	hooking	up	a	module	builder	to	a	tractor,	keep	hands	away	from	the	drawbar.	Pinching	and crushing of hands and fingers can result from sudden motions of the drawbar.</list_item>
<list_item><loc_59><loc_223><loc_439><loc_248>Do	not	park	module	builder	in	the	transport	position	without	inserting	safety	pins	to	lock	the	wheels and prevent accidental lowering. The best practice is to lower the module builder onto the skids when not in use to prevent the possibility of someone crawling under module builder.</list_item>
<list_item><loc_59><loc_257><loc_439><loc_282>Do	not	reach	under	a	raised	module	builder.	This	is	especially	important	for	those	who	place	tarp ties under the module builder prior to building a new module. Use a tool to transfer the tie from one side to the other.</list_item>
<list_item><loc_59><loc_291><loc_292><loc_297>Never	enter	the	module	builder	chamber	while	in	operation.</list_item>
<list_item><loc_59><loc_306><loc_438><loc_331>Make	sure	the	tramper	cylinder	is	lowered	into	the	transport	position	when	moving	the	module builder on roadways or around overhead obstructions. When the hydraulic cylinder is in the operating position, there is high potential for catching wires and tree limbs when moving the builder.</list_item>
<list_item><loc_59><loc_340><loc_440><loc_365>Do	not	build	modules	near	overhead	obstructions.	Always	evaluate	the	area	around	the	builder when selecting a location to form a module. Be aware of overhead obstructions that might interfere with boll buggies and harvesters dumping into the module builder.</list_item>
<list_item><loc_59><loc_374><loc_436><loc_399>Ensure	that	there	is	clearance	before	opening	and	closing	the	module	door.	If	the	hydraulic	valve opening and closing the door is located in a position where the area behind the module cannot be seen, a spotter should be used to ensure adequate clearance.</list_item>
<list_item><loc_59><loc_408><loc_423><loc_424>Modules	are	not	billboards.	Mark	modules	only	with	necessary	identifying	marks,	and	only	with approved module-marking materials.</list_item>
<list_item><loc_59><loc_433><loc_439><loc_449>Do	not	walk	around	the	top	of	module	builder	to	clear	material	from	a	boll	buggy	or	to	move	cotton into the chamber. Avoid situations where there is a high potential for falls.</list_item>

<unordered_list><list_item><loc_59><loc_135><loc_435><loc_169>When	unloading	half-length	modules	from	the	Case	IH	cotton	picker,	avoid	overhead	obstructions that might be contacted when the chamber is raised. If cover crews or other workers are in the area, make sure all personnel are in view or someone signals 'all clear' before unloading the module. This is especially true when staging a second module near another.</list_item>
<list_item><loc_59><loc_179><loc_435><loc_204>When	unloading	round	modules	from	a	John	Deere	cotton	picker,	be	aware	of	the	slope	when dropping off a module from the carrier. While the tendency for the round modules to roll is low, it is possible on steeper slopes.</list_item>
<list_item><loc_59><loc_213><loc_397><loc_219>Do	not	allow	personnel	behind	or	in	the	bed	of	the	module	truck	when	loading	modules.</list_item>
<list_item><loc_59><loc_228><loc_432><loc_253>Module	trucks	are	not	to	back	up	to	the	module	feeder	without	direction	from	module	feeder operator or other system to ensure area is clear of personnel. The module mover should be equipped with a back-up warning system to alert gin personnel of equipment moving backwards.</list_item>
<list_item><loc_59><loc_262><loc_443><loc_296>Do	not	cross	between	modules	while	on	feeder	table	to	remove	covers.	Employees	have	been trapped between modules, resulting in loss of life. Loosen the cover on the loading end of the feeder, pull it to the end of the module and then off the side. This strategy will keep workers safely to the side of the modules.</list_item>
<list_item><loc_59><loc_305><loc_346><loc_312>Do	not	get	on	the	module	floor	unless	feeder	system	is	off	and	locked	out.</list_item>
<list_item><loc_59><loc_321><loc_442><loc_346>When	using	an	automated	roller	for	rolling	tarps,	the	operator	should	have	a	dead	man's	foot	switch to control the roller power. The rolls are a severe pinch point, and arms have been broken when caught in a powered roller.</list_item>
