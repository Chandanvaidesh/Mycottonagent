<text><loc_46><loc_355><loc_244><loc_469>Major types of mechanisms involved in harvesting of cotton were suction or mechanical type.  Mechanical  picking  mechanisms  involved brush type, pin & finger type, spindle type, beater type, auger type, bristle type, tooth picking and saw type. Spindle type mechanism was found to be  successful  in  picking  seed  cotton  in  Europe and American countries. Presently, spindle type cotton mechanism is mostly used by mechanical cotton  pickers  across  most  cotton  producing countries.  However,  another  system  known  as cotton stripping became popular wherever Ultra Narrow  Row  cotton  cultivation is practiced. Stripper type harvesters are positioned as suitable to small holder farms which are dominant across</text>

The  past two decades have seen efforts being  made  by  public as  well  as  private  establishments  to  popularise mechanised  cotton  picking  in  India.  Although, significant improvements have been made and  many  of  the  constraints  removed  over  the years, large scale adoption still eludes the cotton ecosystem.  This  paper  presents  the  evolution of  the  picker  technology  development  in  India and discusses ways to overcome challenges and suggests  pathway  to  be  followed  to  realise  this goal.</text>
<text><loc_259><loc_424><loc_457><loc_468>Cotton  is  cultivated  in  three  distinct  agroecological  regions  (North,  Central  and  South) of  the  country.  Approximately  65  percent  of India's  cotton  is  produced  on  dry  land  and 35  percent  on  irrigated  land.  Small  holdings, complex land tenure arrangement and excessive</text>

<text><loc_45><loc_47><loc_243><loc_122>farm  fragmentation,  further  limit  the  scope  for sophisticated  farm  power  system  more  suited to  large  land  holdings of North Zones. In small and  marginal  farms,  except  for  tillage,  other operations such as sowing, weeding, cotton picking harvesting and stalk uprooting are normally  performed  using  animate  sources  of power.  Though,  India  has  an  abundant  labour force in agriculture, non-availability of manpower during peak crop season is a growing problem.</text>
<text><loc_45><loc_132><loc_243><loc_223>Cotton harvesting in India is done manually whether it is rainfed or irrigated and it is a highly labor-intensive operation. Manual picking is not only  tedious  but  amounts  to  more  than  35%  of the labour used in cotton cultivation. Due to nonavailability  of  labor  in  time,  cotton  picking  gets delayed causing around 15 per cent field loss and affecting  the  overall  quality  of  cotton  lint.  The change in weather forces the farmers to harvest cotton quickly and non-availability of labour and less  available  time  makes  it  an  expensive  and complex process.</text>
<text><loc_45><loc_233><loc_243><loc_362>Adopting mechanical cotton picking, therefore, was felt necessary as early as 1972, when efforts were made by CCSHAU, Hissar, to develop a  knapsack  vacuum  cotton  picker.  A  laboratory model of blower fan for creating vacuum in the picking zone for the development of a pneumatic cotton  picker  was  fabricated.  However,  further work could not be taken up as the model ended up  picking  up  a  lot  of  trash.  Muthamiselvan  et al.  (2007)  developed  a  knapsack  cotton  picker, however,  the  rate  of  work  was  found  dismally low.  It  was,  therefore,  evident  that  any  system that  picked  one  boll  at  a  time  was  more  labour intensive than a human picker. This is the reason the  hand-held  pickers  which  were  introduced in the Indian market at a later date, did not gain popularity.</text>

The  performance  of  the cotton  picker  was  evaluated  at  PAU  Ludhiana and CICR, Nagpur. Tests at PAU, Ludhiana were conducted on LH 1556 having an average plant height of 112.9 cm. The mean values of forward speed,  effective  field  capacity,  total  harvesting loss,  mechanical  picking  efficiency  and  picker efficiency were 2.62 kmph, 0.28 ha/h, 23.62 %, 75.7 % and 76.4 %, respectively. The field evaluation of cotton picker at CICR, Nagpur was conducted on seven varieties/genotypes, namely CNH 120 MB, CNH 123, CNH 155, CNH 911, CNH 2713, CNH  4736  and  GSH  2.  The  average  height  of plant and lowermost boll were 85.9 cm, 86.0 cm, 98.1  cm,  81.9  cm,  73.2  cm,  77.8  cm  and  86.3  cm and  9.0  cm,  10.9  cm,  21.6  cm,  11.6  cm,  16.4  cm and  12.3  cm  for  CNH  120  MB,  CNH  123,  CNH 155, CNH 911, CNH 2713, CNH 4736 and GSH 2, respectively. The mean values of forward speed, effective  field  capacity,  fuel  consumption,  total harvesting loss, mechanical picking efficiency and picker efficiency were 2.20-3.38 kmph, 0.278-0.563 ha/h, 22.0 - 24.0 l/h, 14.29-31.74 %, 55.6 - 83.1 % and 68.3-85.7 %, respectively. Trash content in the machine picked cotton was found to be 22-26 %. The  cultural  practices  and  staggered  blooming characteristics of Indian cotton varieties and hybrids posed a great hinderance to mechanised cotton picking.</text>

Optimum  use  of Nitrogen coupled with use of PGR will facilitate machine picking. Several PGRs such as Livosin, cycocel,  etc.  are  available  in  the  market.  It  can be  used  once  or  multiple  application  during the flowering period to reduce plant height and improve  yield  through  higher  fruit  retention. While  reduction  in  growth  following  cycocel treatments was observed by all workers, improvement  in  yield  also  was  noted  by  many</text>

<text><loc_259><loc_232><loc_457><loc_362>Use  of  defoliant  is  inevitable  for  efficient and  trash  free  picking  of  cotton  by  mechanical harvester.  Mechanical  picking  of  cotton  with spindle  type  picker  has  to  be  preceded  with chemical defoliation of cotton plants since leaves add to the trash  content  which  downgrade the  quality  of  cotton.  At  present  there  are  no registered  defoliants  available  in  India.  There is  need  for  a  better  defoliant  to  ensure  more defoliation prior to machine picking with minimum  trash  content.  ICAR-CICR,  Nagpur is  testing  a  defoliant  chemical  formulation  over two  seasons.  Among  the  defoliants  tested  in the  North  Zone,  application  at  7  days  interval resulted in highest number of fully opened bolls per plant (28.0), boll opening percentage (97.3%) and defoliation percentage (92.6%) (Fig 2).</text>

However, apart from on-going research, concerted efforts are needed to rope in agro-chemical input firms for registering proven  and  effective  defoliant  chemical(s)  for commercial  use  on  cotton  in  the  country  at  the earliest to facilitate mechanical cotton picking.</text>
<text><loc_45><loc_134><loc_243><loc_201>Plant,  soil  and  environmental  (temperature and humidity) conditions also play a critical role in  the  effectiveness  of  defoliation  and  resultant level  of  trash  content  in  mechanically  harvested cotton. Genotypes with less leaf biomass, avoiding excessive plant stress, prevalence of night temperatures above 20 O C are some critical factors. Performance of the defoliant will be more evident when used under ideal environmental conditions.</text>
<text><loc_45><loc_211><loc_243><loc_317>It  is  high  time  that  such  cotton  growing locations of sizeable area are identified in different states and the complete package comprising of mechanical sowing at high density,  nutrient  management  (need  based  N application),  crop  growth  regulation  with  PGR, and  defoliant  application  in  right  conditions  is done  for  mechanical  harvesting  of  cotton  with commercially  available  two  row  spindle  type pickers  and  picked  cotton  is  tested  for  trash content  before  and  after  pre-cleaning  and  postcleaning at the ginnery.

Thousand (869) ginning factories of India have been modernised with pre-cleaner and post-cleaner under Technology  Mission  of Cotton (Mini Mission IV). Additional pre and post-cleaners specific for machine picked cotton will have to be installed in the ginning factories with support under a phase II  of  TMC.  Testing  equipment  (HVI)  installed  at the ginning factories will further establish the fibre quality of machine picked cotton. These changes will eventually pave way for lint-based marketing of quality cotton and result in a win-win situation for producers and downstream players.</text>

<text><loc_259><loc_331><loc_457><loc_468>Scarcity  of  labour  and  therefore,  the  higher cost of picking seed cotton and consequent higher cost of cultivation will eventually pave the way for  mechanical  harvesting  of  cotton  in  India. Cotton is grown in all categories of land holdings and under all sources of power. Therefore, cotton harvesters  will  need  to  come  in  all  shapes  and sizes, harnessing the available power to satiate the demands of Indian cotton. Many of the constraints and  bottlenecks  faced  while  popularising  the earlier cotton pickers have now been adequately addressed to pave the way for wider adaptability of the picker.  With the advent of new genotypes, it may be possible to introduce mechanical cotton pickers  successfully.  The  trash  content  in  the machine picked cotton has significantly reduced from earlier 20% to 10-12% and the efficiency of picking has gone up from 85 to 95%.</text>
