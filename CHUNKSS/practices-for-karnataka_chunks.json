  "approved package of practice for cotton in karnataka state cotton is a major commercial crop grown in almost all the agro - climatic zones of karnataka. all the four cultivated species of cotton viz,. gossypium arboreum, g. herbaceum, g. barbadense, and g. hirsutum are grown in the state where in gossypium hirsutum has the major share of the hybrid cotton grown. area under cotton during the year 2007 - 08, was 3. 7 lakh hectares with a production and productivity of 6. 0 lakh bales and 365 kg lint / ha respectively. area under bt cotton was to the extent of 0. 8 lakh hectares during 2007 - 08. the package of practices developed for different species of cotton and agro - climatic situations is summarized as below. 1. crop improvement 1. 1 cotton varieties / hybrids released for cultivation in the state glyph < 1 > glyph < 1 > glyph < 1 > glyph < 2 > glyph < 3 > glyph < 4 > glyph < 3 > glyph < 5 > glyph < 2 > glyph < 6 > glyph < 5 > glyph < 7 > glyph < 2 > glyph < 4 > glyph < 8 > glyph < 9 > glyph < 9 > glyph < 10 > glyph < 11 > glyph < 3 > glyph < 12 > glyph < 11 > glyph < 7 > glyph < 13 > glyph < 9 > glyph < 6 > glyph < 14 > glyph < 9 > glyph < 10 > glyph < 5 > glyph < 11 > glyph < 3 > glyph < 15 > glyph < 4 > glyph < 3 > glyph < 13 > glyph < 9 > glyph < 14 > glyph < 6 > glyph < 5 > glyph < 9 > glyph < 16 > glyph < 6 > glyph < 15 > glyph < 15 > glyph < 6 > glyph < 8 > glyph < 9 > glyph < 4 > glyph < 8 > glyph < 9 > glyph < 17 > glyph < 11 > glyph < 5 > gly",
