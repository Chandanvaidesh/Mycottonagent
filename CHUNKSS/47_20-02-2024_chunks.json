  "##ological regions ( north, central and south ) of the country. approximately 65 percent of india ' s cotton is produced on dry land and 35 percent on irrigated land. small holdings, complex land tenure arrangement and excessive 2 20 th february, 2024 cotton statistics & news farm fragmentation, further limit the scope for sophisticated farm power system more suited to large land holdings of north zones. in small and marginal farms, except for tillage, other operations such as sowing, weeding, cotton picking harvesting and stalk uprooting are normally performed using animate sources of power. though, india has an abundant labour force in agriculture, non - availability of manpower during peak crop season is a growing problem. cotton harvesting in india is done manually whether it is rainfed or irrigated and it is a highly labor - intensive operation. manual picking is not only tedious but amounts to more than 35 % of the labour used in cotton cultivation. due to nonavailability of labor in time, cotton picking gets delayed causing around 15 per cent field loss and affecting the overall quality of cotton lint. the change in weather forces the farmers to harvest cotton quickly and non - availability of labour and less available time makes it an expensive and complex process. adopting mechanical cotton picking, therefore, was felt necessary as early as 1972, when efforts were made by ccshau, hissar, to develop a knapsack vacuum cotton picker. a laboratory model of blower fan for creating vacuum in the picking zone for the development of a pneumatic cotton picker was fabricated. however, further work could not be taken up as the model ended up picking up a lot of trash. muthamiselvan et al. ( 2007 ) developed a knapsack cotton picker, however, the rate of work was found dismally low. it was, therefore, evident that any system that picked one boll at a time was more labour intensive than a human picker. this is the reason the hand - held pickers which were introduced in the indian market at a later date, did not gain popularity. efforts to introduce spindle type cotton picker in india in 2003 - 04, a study was conducted on the performance of an imported john deere 9935 two - row self - propelled cotton picker at different locations in india under natp project on ' adoption and refinement of a cotton picker and cleaning system '. the performance of the cotton picker was evaluated at pau ludhiana and cicr, nagpur. tests",

  "were evaluated for compactness during kharif 2022. the varieties were planted at 90 x 10cm spacing and hybrids were planted at 90 x 15 cm spacing. among varieties, nano produced the highest seed cotton yield with mepiquat chloride application and the height of lower most boll was 18 cm from ground surface. among hybrids, rch 608 bg ii recorded the highest seed cotton yield. however, rch 578 bg ii recorded better ground clearance for machine picking as the height of lower most boll was 23cm. under the special cotton project, ' targeting technology to agro - ecological zone large scale demonstrations of 14 hdps compact genotypes in 8 states covering 52 districts in an area of 3000 ha has been conducted ( fig 1b ) '. plant growth regulator ( pgr ) pgr is used in cotton to regulate vegetative growth of the plant, to reduce plant height and ensure better harvest index. optimum use of nitrogen coupled with use of pgr will facilitate machine picking. several pgrs such as livosin, cycocel, etc. are available in the market. it can be used once or multiple application during the flowering period to reduce plant height and improve yield through higher fruit retention. while reduction in growth following cycocel treatments was observed by all workers, improvement in yield also was noted by many ( basu et. al. 1979 ). more potent pgrs are likely to be available in future. in a trial of evaluation of defoliants and growth regulators at icar - cicr, subiksha and suraksha among varieties and ch 578 bgii among hybrids outperformed the rest in terms of compactness and height of lowermost boll, with the application of mepiquat chloride growth regulator. defoliation use of defoliant is inevitable for efficient and trash free picking of cotton by mechanical harvester. mechanical picking of cotton with spindle type picker has to be preceded with chemical defoliation of cotton plants since leaves add to the trash content which downgrade the quality of cotton. at present there are no registered defoliants available in india. there is need for a better defoliant to ensure more defoliation prior to machine picking with minimum trash content. icar - cicr, nagpur is testing a defoliant chemical formulation over two seasons. among the defoliants tested in the north zone, application at 7 days interval resulted in highest number of fully opened bolls per plant ( 28.",
  "icar - cicr, nagpur is testing a defoliant chemical formulation over two seasons. among the defoliants tested in the north zone, application at 7 days interval resulted in highest number of fully opened bolls per plant ( 28. 0 ), boll opening percentage ( 97. 3 % ) and defoliation percentage ( 92. 6 % ) ( fig 2 ). fig. 2 : testing of defoliants in cotton cotton association of india 20 th february, 2024 5 for machine harvesting at coimbatore centre, icar - cicr defoliant was sprayed when the crop was 140 days old and desired level of boll opening and defoliation was achieved, outperforming the commercially available salts. however, apart from on - going research, concerted efforts are needed to rope in agro - chemical input firms for registering proven and effective defoliant chemical ( s ) for commercial use on cotton in the country at the earliest to facilitate mechanical cotton picking. plant, soil and environmental ( temperature and humidity ) conditions also play a critical role in the effectiveness of defoliation and resultant level of trash content in mechanically harvested cotton. genotypes with less leaf biomass, avoiding excessive plant stress, prevalence of night temperatures above 20 o c are some critical factors. performance of the defoliant will be more evident when used under ideal environmental conditions. it is high time that such cotton growing locations of sizeable area are identified in different states and the complete package comprising of mechanical sowing at high density, nutrient management ( need based n application ), crop growth regulation with pgr, and defoliant application in right conditions is done for mechanical harvesting of cotton with commercially available two row spindle type pickers and picked cotton is tested for trash content before and after pre - cleaning and postcleaning at the ginnery. such effective defoliants need to be registered for commercial use and their availability ensured for realising the potential. performance of spindle type picker in cotton variety suraksha at coimbatore regional station of icarcicr, 150 days old cotton variety suraksha under hdps system ( 90 x 10 cm spacing ) in one - hectare was harvested using shaktiman cotton master 1437 spindle type two row picker ( fig 3 ). the field capacity of the picker was one acre per hour. the total trash content in the harvested kapas ranged from 8. 96 - 12. 44 % on seed cotton basis ( fig 4 ). on seed",
  "picker ( fig 3 ). the field capacity of the picker was one acre per hour. the total trash content in the harvested kapas ranged from 8. 96 - 12. 44 % on seed cotton basis ( fig 4 ). on seed cotton basis, dried / green leaves, bracts / burrs and sticks contributed 5 %, 2. 9 % and 0. 6 % of mean trash content, respectively. trash content in machine picked cotton ginning factories are most crucial for success or otherwise of machine picked cotton in india because it is here that most trash of the machine fig. 3 : icar - cicr cotton variety suraksha being harvested using two row spindle type cotton picker fig 4 : trash constituents in machine picked picked cotton will be eliminated. thousand ( 869 ) ginning factories of india have been modernised with pre - cleaner and post - cleaner under technology mission of cotton ( mini mission iv ). additional pre and post - cleaners specific for machine picked cotton will have to be installed in the ginning factories with support under a phase ii of tmc. testing equipment ( hvi ) installed at the ginning factories will further establish the fibre quality of machine picked cotton. these changes will eventually pave way for lint - based marketing of quality cotton and result in a win - win situation for producers and downstream players. conclusion scarcity of labour and therefore, the higher cost of picking seed cotton and consequent higher cost of cultivation will eventually pave the way for mechanical harvesting of cotton in india. cotton is grown in all categories of land holdings and under all sources of power. therefore, cotton harvesters will need to come in all shapes and sizes, harnessing the available power to satiate the demands of indian cotton. many of the constraints and bottlenecks faced while popularising the earlier cotton pickers have now been adequately addressed to pave the way for wider adaptability of the picker. with the advent of new genotypes, it may be possible to introduce mechanical cotton pickers successfully. the trash content in the machine picked cotton has significantly reduced from earlier 20 % to 10 - 12 % and the efficiency of picking has gone up from 85 to 95 %. 6 20 th february, 2024 cotton statistics & news the pathway for mechanication of cotton harvesting entails meeting three essential requirements now : scaling up of hdps, a global best practice, in suitable growing environments with amenable early maturing compact genotypes grown at prescribed spacing and canopy management with use of pg",
