in cotton : grow sucking pest tolerant / resistant varieties / hybrids. seed treatment with imidacloprid 70 ws 5. 0 g / kg or thiamethoxam 70 ws 4. 0 g / kg or imidacloprid 48 fs @ 9. 0 ml / kg or carbosulfan 25 ds @ 40. 0 g / kg of seed, gives early protection against sucking pests. growing of intercrops like mungbean or urdbean or soybean or cluster bean in 1 : 2 or 1 : 3 ratio will facilitate the buildup of native natural enemy populations that in turn keep sucking pests under check growing of cowpea as bund crop is advantageous to encourage predacious insects like coccinellids, syrphids and chrysopids maize or sorghum or pearlmillet grown as barrier crops in the border prevents spread from neighbouring fields. stem application at 30 & 45 das with monocrotophos ( 1 : 4 ) and at 60 das with imidacloprid ( 1 : 20 ) for protecting the crop from early season sucking pests is highly effective. setting up of yellow sticky traps @ 10 per acre for monitoring whitefly incidence. economic threshold level ( etl ) for sucking pests on cotton is presented hereunder : 2 9. etl based application of insecticides leafhoppers / aphids / thrips - monocrotophos 36 sl @ 1. 6 ml / l or acephate 75 sp @ 1. 5g / l or imidacloprid 17. 8 sl @ 0. 4 ml / l or acetamiprid 20 sp @ 0. 2 g / l or thiamethoxam 25 wg @ 0. 2 g / l or fipronil 5 sc @ 2. 0 ml / l whitefly - triazophos 40 ec @ 2. 0 ml / l or profenophos 50 ec @ 2. 0 ml / l or diafenthiuron 50 % wp @ 1. 25 g / l or nske @ 5 % ( extract from 10. 0 kg of neem powder / acre ) red mite - wettable sulphur 80 wp @ 3. 0 g / l or dicofol 18. 5 sc @ 5. 0 ml / l insecticide resistance management strategies to manage cotton pests in bt - cotton early sucking pest window 1 : 0 - 60 das : no foliar spray up
