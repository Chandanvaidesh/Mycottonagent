ridge timely sowing reduces the incidence of insects and diseases late sowing as practiced by most cotton farmers may result to reduced cotton yield by about 46 % - all missing stands should be reseeded week after sowing. fertilizer management with 4r nutrient stewardship nutrient where available and for good mineralization stewardship of organic manure, it should be incorporated into the soil at least 2 weeks before sowing at the rate of 8 - 10 tonslha apply fertilizer at the rate of 100 kg nitrogen : 40 kg phosphorus : 40 kg potassium / ha 8 number of 50 kg bags ( 4ookg ) of indorama npk is required for hectare of cotton which will supply the full dose of phosphorus and potassium the balance of nitrogen is supplied 2 numbers 50 kg bags ( 100 kgs ) indorama neem coated urea in split applications using the first split dose of neem coated urea is applied at 3 - 4 weeks after basal application and the remaining half applied at 6 - 8 weeks apply the urea fertilizer 10 cm away from crop using side placement method. the pre planting herbicide application land preparation with npk fertiliser harvesting 14 dais before second neem urea application seed treatment 2 hoe weeding sowing 3 wffks after sowing pre emergence herbicide application gap filling and irrigation first neem urea application indorama fertilizer : improving agriculture, improving lives 140 160 sowing ; 1 1 1 1 wefks after after sowing sowing practices best farming to how to reduce nitrogen loss apply nitrogen fertilizer early in the morning or evening avoid nitrogen fertilizer application when it is about to rain or when the weather is cloudy do not apply nitrogen fertilizer at once but in split doses to minimize losses. avoid broadcast method of fertilizer application : apply nitrogen fertilizer after weeding to prevent competition from weeds apply only the recommended dose of nitrogen fertilizer proper drainage will reduce nitrogen loss due to runoff. weed control hoe weeding should be carefully carried out at 4 and 8 weeks after sowing. for pre - emergence herbicide ; apply 2 l / ha diuron 80 % wp 3 days after sowing. post - emergence herbicide ; apply fulsilate forte at rate of 1. 5 llha at 5 weeks after planting depending on the intensity of weeds use of tolerantlresistant varieties harvesting and crop storage harvesting is done when there are reasonable number of split bolls ( 50 % ). seed cotton is to be
