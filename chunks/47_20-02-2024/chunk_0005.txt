and pave the way for mechanical harvesting of cotton in india. the following sections illustrate the measures taken in this direction. high density planting system ( hdps ) icar - central institute for cotton research has developed, standardised and conducted large scale demonstrations on ' high density planting system ' ( hdps ) technology package suitable for machine picking. cotton varieties and hybrids ( both bt and non - bt seed types ) were evaluated under hdps for their compactness and amenability to mechanical picking with and without the plant growth regulator ( mepiquat chrolide ) at nagpur, sirsa and coimbatore regional stations of icar - cicr. several compact type genotypes were released by icar - cicr suitable for mechanical harvesting under hdps ( fig. 1a ) central zone, nagpur centre : the promising compact hybrids identified under deep soils in central zone were, rch608, sp7149, ajeet 5 and varieties namely, adb39, co17, which had plant height around 100 cm and canopy width of 50 cm. all the hybrids and varieties evaluated were found to be compact after the application of mepiquat chloride ( 25 g a. i. / ha ) sprayed twice at 45 and 65 days. cicr - h bt cotton 60 ( yugank bt ) cicr - h bt cotton 61 ( tejas bt ) 36. 3 cicr - h bt cotton 62 namami bt ) 38. 2 cicr - h bt cotton 63 ( samrat bt ) 36. 7 ginning % 38. 1 4 20 th february, 2024 cotton statistics & news fig 1b : demonstration of compact genotypes north zone, sirsa centre : thirteen cotton genotypes were tested under hdps ( spacing 90 x 15 cm ). rch - 926and rch 773 bg - ii hybrids, pau bt - 3 and csh - 3075 among varieties were found promising in terms of compactness and higher yields with plant growth regulation. south zone, coimbatore centre : five non - bt varieties ( suraksha, subhiksha, suraj, nano, co17 ) and three bg ii hybrids ( rch 608, ncs 2778 and rch 578 ) were evaluated for compactness during kharif 2022. the varieties were planted at 90 x 10cm spacing and hybrids were planted at 90 x 15 cm spacing. among varieties, nano produced the highest seed cotton yield with mepiquat
