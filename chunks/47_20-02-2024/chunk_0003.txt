picker at different locations in india under natp project on ' adoption and refinement of a cotton picker and cleaning system '. the performance of the cotton picker was evaluated at pau ludhiana and cicr, nagpur. tests at pau, ludhiana were conducted on lh 1556 having an average plant height of 112. 9 cm. the mean values of forward speed, effective field capacity, total harvesting loss, mechanical picking efficiency and picker efficiency were 2. 62 kmph, 0. 28 ha / h, 23. 62 %, 75. 7 % and 76. 4 %, respectively. the field evaluation of cotton picker at cicr, nagpur was conducted on seven varieties / genotypes, namely cnh 120 mb, cnh 123, cnh 155, cnh 911, cnh 2713, cnh 4736 and gsh 2. the average height of plant and lowermost boll were 85. 9 cm, 86. 0 cm, 98. 1 cm, 81. 9 cm, 73. 2 cm, 77. 8 cm and 86. 3 cm and 9. 0 cm, 10. 9 cm, 21. 6 cm, 11. 6 cm, 16. 4 cm and 12. 3 cm for cnh 120 mb, cnh 123, cnh 155, cnh 911, cnh 2713, cnh 4736 and gsh 2, respectively. the mean values of forward speed, effective field capacity, fuel consumption, total harvesting loss, mechanical picking efficiency and picker efficiency were 2. 20 - 3. 38 kmph, 0. 278 - 0. 563 ha / h, 22. 0 - 24. 0 l / h, 14. 29 - 31. 74 %, 55. 6 - 83. 1 % and 68. 3 - 85. 7 %, respectively. trash content in the machine picked cotton was found to be 22 - 26 %. the cultural practices and staggered blooming characteristics of indian cotton varieties and hybrids posed a great hinderance to mechanised cotton picking. pathway for adoption of mechanical harvesting in the current scenario a brain storming session was organised by icar - cicr, nagpur on world cotton day ( 7th october 2021 ), to chalk out a plan to address the challenges in promoting mechanical harvesting with the participation of public sector researchers from icar - cicr, icar - ciae, icar - circot ; seed industry ( rasi seeds ) ; agro - chemical majors :
