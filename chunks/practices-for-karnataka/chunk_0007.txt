irrigation enhances the vegetative growth leading to ineffectiveness of plant protection measures, resulting in higher incidence of pest / diseases under canal command areas where in the canal opening is not assured at scheduled time, ensure early sowing with protective irrigation by open / bore well water. provide drainage in heavy soils to avoid water logging due to low infiltration rate under constraints of irrigation water, foliar spray of kaolin ( 60 g / lit ) with 1 g teepol or soap, at 3 days after last irrigation reduces transpiration losses from the crop canopy, thus helps the crop to utilize the available soil moisture efficiently. 2. 8 drip irrigation in cotton drip irrigation can be a viable option under constraints of irrigation water in zone 3 and 8 for hybrid cotton cultivation. it can save electricity, labour and 50 % of irrigation water as against the surface furrow irrigation planting geometry of 90 cm x 60 cm ( normal planting ) can be adopted under drip irrigation, but paired row planting at 60 cm - 120 cm - 60 cm can save 50 % laterals as against the normal planting glyph < 1 > glyph < 1 > glyph < 1 > glyph < 2 > glyph < 3 > glyph < 4 > glyph < 3 > glyph < 5 > glyph < 2 > glyph < 6 > glyph < 5 > glyph < 7 > glyph < 2 > glyph < 4 > glyph < 8 > glyph < 9 > glyph < 9 > glyph < 10 > glyph < 11 > glyph < 3 > glyph < 12 > glyph < 11 > glyph < 7 > glyph < 13 > glyph < 9 > glyph < 6 > glyph < 14 > glyph < 9 > glyph < 10 > glyph < 5 > glyph < 11 > glyph < 3 > glyph < 15 > glyph < 4 > glyph < 3 > glyph < 13 > glyph < 9 > glyph < 14 > glyph < 6 > glyph < 5 > glyph < 9 > glyph < 16 > glyph < 6 > glyph < 15 > glyph < 15 > glyph < 6 > glyph < 8 > glyph < 9 > glyph < 4 > glyph
