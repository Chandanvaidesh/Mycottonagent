##lisers incorporate organics ( fym / compost / crop residues ) into the soil 2 - 3 weeks before sowing. for rainfed cotton apply entire recommended nutrients as basal at the time of sowing. under assured rainfall conditions apply 50 % n, entire dose of p2o5 and k2o as basal at the time of sowing and top dress remaining 50 % n at 60 das. under irrigated conditions, apply 50 % n & k2o and entire p2o5 as basal at sowing and top dress 50 % n & k2o at 30 das and remaining 25 % n & k2o at 60 das. under irrigated conditions in zone - 3 apply 25 % n & k2o and entire p2o5 as basal at sowing and top dress 50 % n & k2o in three equal splits at 50, 80 and 110 das. under heavy rainfall areas ( malanad ), apply n, p2o5 and k2o in three equal splits i. e basal, 60 and 90 das. in all the situations give foliar sprays of 2 % urea or dap + 1 % mop at 80, 100 & 120 das 2. 6. post sowing operations and weed management keep the plots weed free up to 60 days as the crop growth is slow during this period and this is the critical crop growth stage for crop weed competition. three - four intercultivations at an interval of 15 days after 30 das helps in controlling weeds and acts as dust mulch in conserving the available soil moisture. in rainfed situations weeds can be managed effectively by 2 - 3 intercultivations followed by hand weeding. in transitional and irrigated areas integrated weed management proved effective in controlling the weeds. pre emergent application of diuron ( 80 % ) @ 1. 25 kg / ha or pendimethalin ( 30 ec ) @ 3 lit / ha in 500 - 750 lits of water, immediately after sowing ( with sufficient soil moisture ) coupled with one hand weeding and intercultivation is recommended. glyph < 1 > glyph < 1 > glyph < 1 > glyph < 2 > glyph < 3 > glyph < 4 > glyph < 3 > glyph < 5 > glyph < 2 > glyph < 6 > glyph < 5 > glyph < 7 > glyph < 2 > gly
