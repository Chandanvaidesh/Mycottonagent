( table. 1 ) table. 1 : time schedule of drip operation based on daily et ( zone 3 and 8 ) replenishing 75 % and 50 % daily et for hybrids and varieties respectively. laterals to be placed at 90 cm apart and drippers at 60 cm under normal planting drippers having discharge capacity of 4 lit / sec to be used. in case of paired row planting ( 60 cm - 120 cm - 60 cm ) the above time of drip operation has to be doubled as the number of laterals and drippers are reduced to 50 % as compared to normal planting of 90 cm x 60 cm 2. 8. 1 fertilizer management in drip irrigation system apply 10 percent of recommended fertilizers as basal at the time of sowing and apply remaining fertilizers in equal splits through fertigation between 30 to 120 das at six days interval. urea, mop and dap can be used for fertigation instead of costly liquid fertlisers. follow weed, pest and diseases management practices as mentioned in irrigated cotton 2. 9 cotton based cropping systems. 2. 9. 1 crop rotations. glyph < 1 > glyph < 1 > glyph < 1 > glyph < 2 > glyph < 3 > glyph < 4 > glyph < 3 > glyph < 5 > glyph < 2 > glyph < 6 > glyph < 5 > glyph < 7 > glyph < 2 > glyph < 4 > glyph < 8 > glyph < 9 > glyph < 9 > glyph < 10 > glyph
